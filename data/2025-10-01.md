### [1] [Cyclic Ablation: Testing Concept Localization against Functional Regeneration in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25220)
*Eduard Kapelko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过循环消融方法测试欺骗行为是否可被局部移除，发现欺骗具有高度韧性，每次消融后都能通过对抗训练恢复，且每次尝试都会导致语言性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究欺骗等不良行为是否是局部功能可以被移除，还是与模型核心认知能力深度交织。

Method: 引入循环消融方法，结合稀疏自编码器、定向消融和对抗训练，在DistilGPT-2上尝试消除欺骗概念。

Result: 欺骗行为具有高度韧性，模型通过对抗训练持续恢复欺骗行为（功能再生），且每次消融尝试都导致语言性能逐渐下降（困惑度上升）。

Conclusion: 复杂概念是分布式和纠缠的，通过机制可解释性进行直接模型编辑存在局限性。

Abstract: Safety and controllability are critical for large language models. A central
question is whether undesirable behaviors like deception are localized
functions that can be removed, or if they are deeply intertwined with a model's
core cognitive abilities. We introduce "cyclic ablation," an iterative method
to test this. By combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and
adversarial training on DistilGPT-2, we attempted to eliminate the concept of
deception. We found that, contrary to the localization hypothesis, deception
was highly resilient. The model consistently recovered its deceptive behavior
after each ablation cycle via adversarial training, a process we term
functional regeneration. Crucially, every attempt at this "neurosurgery" caused
a gradual but measurable decay in general linguistic performance, reflected by
a consistent rise in perplexity. These findings are consistent with the view
that complex concepts are distributed and entangled, underscoring the
limitations of direct model editing through mechanistic interpretability.

### [2] [From Internal Representations to Text Quality: A Geometric Approach to LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25359)
*Viacheslav Yusupov,Danil Maksimov,Ameliia Alaeva,Anna Vasileva,Anna Antipina,Tatyana Zaitseva,Alina Ermilova,Evgeny Burnaev,Egor Shvetsov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过证明内部模型表示的几何特性可以作为评估生成文本质量的可靠代理，将大语言模型的内部分析与外部分析方法联系起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连接大语言模型的内部分析和外部分析方法，寻找无需人工标注数据集的文本质量评估方法。

Method: 验证了一组在LLM不同层测量的指标，包括最大可解释方差、有效秩、内在维度、MAUVE分数和Schatten范数。

Result: 发现内在维度和有效秩可以作为文本自然性和质量的通用评估指标，不同模型基于这些几何特性对各种来源的文本进行一致排序。

Conclusion: 这些几何指标反映了文本的内在特征而非模型特定的人工产物，为自动化评估流程提供了无需参考的文本质量评估方法。

Abstract: This paper bridges internal and external analysis approaches to large
language models (LLMs) by demonstrating that geometric properties of internal
model representations serve as reliable proxies for evaluating generated text
quality. We validate a set of metrics including Maximum Explainable Variance,
Effective Rank, Intrinsic Dimensionality, MAUVE score, and Schatten Norms
measured across different layers of LLMs, demonstrating that Intrinsic
Dimensionality and Effective Rank can serve as universal assessments of text
naturalness and quality. Our key finding reveals that different models
consistently rank text from various sources in the same order based on these
geometric properties, indicating that these metrics reflect inherent text
characteristics rather than model-specific artifacts. This allows a
reference-free text quality evaluation that does not require human-annotated
datasets, offering practical advantages for automated evaluation pipelines.

### [3] [Generative Value Conflicts Reveal LLM Priorities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25369)
*Andy Liu,Kshitish Ghate,Mona Diab,Daniel Fried,Atoosa Kasirzadeh,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConflictScope是一个自动评估LLM在价值冲突中如何优先排序不同价值的管道，发现在开放评估中模型从保护性价值转向个人价值，系统提示可将对齐效果提升14%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐数据集缺乏价值冲突评估，需要评估LLM在价值冲突中的优先排序能力。

Method: 构建ConflictScope自动管道，从用户定义的价值集中生成价值冲突场景，使用LLM编写的用户提示评估目标模型的自由文本响应。

Result: 在开放评估中，模型从保护性价值转向支持个人价值；系统提示可将与目标排序的对齐效果提升14%。

Conclusion: 评估模型价值优先排序很重要，系统提示在价值冲突中对齐LLM行为有一定效果，为未来研究提供基础。

Abstract: Past work seeks to align large language model (LLM)-based assistants with a
target set of values, but such assistants are frequently forced to make
tradeoffs between values when deployed. In response to the scarcity of value
conflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an
automatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a
user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in
which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the
set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written "user prompt" and
evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the
value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended
evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values,
such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user
autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including
detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a
target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate
success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict. Our work demonstrates
the importance of evaluating value prioritization in models and provides a
foundation for future work in this area.

### [4] [From Faithfulness to Correctness: Generative Reward Models that Think Critically](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25409)
*Qiyao Ma,Yunsheng Shi,Hongtao Tian,Chao Wang,Weiming Chang,Ting Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM)，通过句子级思考监督赋予奖励模型批判性思维能力，解决开放域问答中难以验证正确性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR在数学和编码等可验证领域表现良好，但在开放域问答中面临挑战，因为难以可靠评估正确性。现有方法过度关注忠实度，导致模型过度依赖外部知识而缺乏批判性评估能力。

Method: TRM将奖励建模结构化为忠实度、推理和正确性评估的序列。首先评估每个答案句子对支持文档的忠实度，然后通过推理步骤评估句子级正确性。

Result: 实验表明TRM显著提高了错误句子的识别能力，将TRM融入策略优化后，在答案正确性和实用性方面都取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: TRM通过引入批判性思维监督，有效平衡了外部知识和内部知识的使用，提升了开放域问答任务的性能。

Abstract: Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language
models have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable
outcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex
tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges
due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous
nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate
correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend
beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of
both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on
improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting
documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and
diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose
the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level
thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.
Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the
faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then
applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring
reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness
evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both
external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that
TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and
incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both
answer correctness and usefulness.

### [5] [Emotion-Aligned Generation in Diffusion Text to Speech Models via Preference-Guided Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25416)
*Jiacheng Shi,Hongfei Du,Yangfan He,Y. Alicia Hong,Ye Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EASPO是一个后训练框架，通过扩散TTS模型在中间去噪步骤中对齐细粒度情感偏好，实现可控的情感塑造


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖粗粒度标签或代理分类器，仅获得话语级别反馈，无法实现细粒度情感控制

Method: 引入EASPM时间条件模型对噪声中间语音状态评分，自动构建偏好对，通过EASPO优化生成以匹配这些逐步偏好

Result: 实验显示在表达性和自然度方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: EASPO框架能够有效提升情感文本到语音的细粒度控制能力

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech seeks to convey affect while preserving
intelligibility and prosody, yet existing methods rely on coarse labels or
proxy classifiers and receive only utterance-level feedback. We introduce
Emotion-Aware Stepwise Preference Optimization (EASPO), a post-training
framework that aligns diffusion TTS with fine-grained emotional preferences at
intermediate denoising steps. Central to our approach is EASPM, a
time-conditioned model that scores noisy intermediate speech states and enables
automatic preference pair construction. EASPO optimizes generation to match
these stepwise preferences, enabling controllable emotional shaping.
Experiments show superior performance over existing methods in both
expressiveness and naturalness.

### [6] [SimulRAG: Simulator-based RAG for Grounding LLMs in Long-form Scientific QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25459)
*Haozhou Xu,Dongxia Wu,Matteo Chinazzi,Ruijia Niu,Rose Yu,Yi-An Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SimulRAG框架，通过科学模拟器检索增强LLM的长篇科学问答，解决幻觉问题，在信息量和事实性上显著优于传统RAG方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在长篇科学问答中容易产生幻觉，而科学模拟器作为验证假设的重要工具，可以增强答案的事实性，但现有RAG方法无法直接应用于科学模拟器检索。

Method: 提出SimulRAG框架，包括通用模拟器检索接口（文本与数值模态转换）和基于不确定性估计与模拟器边界评估（UE+SBA）的声明级生成方法。

Result: 在气候科学和流行病学基准测试中，SimulRAG在信息量上比传统RAG基线提升30.4%，在事实性上提升16.3%。UE+SBA进一步提高了生成效率和质置。

Conclusion: SimulRAG通过科学模拟器检索有效缓解了LLM在长篇科学问答中的幻觉问题，显著提升了答案的信息量和事实性，为科学领域的可信AI应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving scientific problems.
They can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are
crucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require
detailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence.
However, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging
task of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to
improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a
vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval
source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However,
existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific
simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve
from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form
answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG
framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering
climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations
and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator
retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We
further design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty
estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently
verify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG
outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in
factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level
generation.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is undergoing constant transformation, as
Large Language Models (LLMs) are driving daily breakthroughs in research and
practice. In this regard, tracking the progress of NLP research and
automatically analyzing the contributions of research papers provides key
insights into the nature of the field and the researchers. This study explores
the progress of African NLP (AfricaNLP) by asking (and answering) basic
research questions such as: i) How has the nature of NLP evolved over the last
two decades?, ii) What are the contributions of AfricaNLP papers?, and iii)
Which individuals and organizations (authors, affiliated institutions, and
funding bodies) have been involved in the development of AfricaNLP? We
quantitatively examine the contributions of AfricaNLP research using 1.9K NLP
paper abstracts, 4.9K author contributors, and 7.8K human-annotated
contribution sentences (AfricaNLPContributions) along with benchmark results.
Our dataset and continuously existing NLP progress tracking website provide a
powerful lens for tracing AfricaNLP research trends and hold potential for
generating data-driven literature surveys.

### [8] [Not Wrong, But Untrue: LLM Overconfidence in Document-Based Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25498)
*Nick Hagar,Wilma Agustianto,Nicholas Diakopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估ChatGPT、Gemini和NotebookLM在基于300份TikTok诉讼政策文档的新闻报道任务中的幻觉问题，发现30%输出存在幻觉，其中Gemini和ChatGPT的幻觉率是NotebookLM的3倍。主要问题不是虚构实体，而是解释性过度自信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在新闻编辑室工作流程中应用日益广泛，但其幻觉倾向对新闻业的核心实践（来源、归属、准确性）构成风险，需要系统评估这些工具在真实报道任务中的表现。

Method: 基于300份TikTok诉讼政策相关文档构建报道任务，测试三种工具（ChatGPT、Gemini、NotebookLM），变化提示语特异性和上下文大小，使用分类法对句子级输出进行注释以衡量幻觉类型和严重程度。

Result: 30%的模型输出至少包含一个幻觉，Gemini和ChatGPT的幻觉率约为40%，是NotebookLM（13%）的3倍。主要错误类型是解释性过度自信，模型添加无支持的来源描述，将归属观点转化为一般陈述。

Conclusion: LLMs与新闻业存在根本的认识论不匹配：新闻要求每个主张都有明确来源，而LLMs无论证据支持如何都会生成权威性文本。需要新闻业特定的幻觉分类扩展和能够强制准确归属而非优化流畅性的架构。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in newsroom workflows, but
their tendency to hallucinate poses risks to core journalistic practices of
sourcing, attribution, and accuracy. We evaluate three widely used tools -
ChatGPT, Gemini, and NotebookLM - on a reporting-style task grounded in a
300-document corpus related to TikTok litigation and policy in the U.S. We vary
prompt specificity and context size and annotate sentence-level outputs using a
taxonomy to measure hallucination type and severity. Across our sample, 30% of
model outputs contained at least one hallucination, with rates approximately
three times higher for Gemini and ChatGPT (40%) than for NotebookLM (13%).
Qualitatively, most errors did not involve invented entities or numbers;
instead, we observed interpretive overconfidence - models added unsupported
characterizations of sources and transformed attributed opinions into general
statements. These patterns reveal a fundamental epistemological mismatch: While
journalism requires explicit sourcing for every claim, LLMs generate
authoritative-sounding text regardless of evidentiary support. We propose
journalism-specific extensions to existing hallucination taxonomies and argue
that effective newsroom tools need architectures that enforce accurate
attribution rather than optimize for fluency.

### [9] [Beyond WER: Probing Whisper's Sub-token Decoder Across Diverse Language Resource Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25516)
*Siyu Liang,Nicolas Ballier,Gina-Anne Levow,Richard Wright*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对Whisper多语言解码器进行细粒度分析，揭示不同资源水平语言在子词解码过程中的系统性差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索端到端多语言ASR模型内部机制，特别是在跨语言公平性和有效性方面的表现

Method: 通过追踪束搜索路径，捕获子词假设及其相关概率，使用PCA和t-SNE分析子词使用模式

Result: 高资源语言在正确token排名、置信度、预测熵和候选多样性方面表现更好；低资源语言在这些指标上较差，但显示出受类型学影响的子词使用聚类模式

Conclusion: 子词探测揭示了被聚合错误率掩盖的系统性解码差异，为改善语音技术不平衡发展提供了针对性干预方向

Abstract: While large multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models achieve
remarkable performance, the internal mechanisms of the end-to-end pipeline,
particularly concerning fairness and efficacy across languages, remain
underexplored. This paper introduces a fine-grained analysis of Whisper's
multilingual decoder, examining its sub-token hypotheses during transcription
across languages with various resource levels. Our method traces the beam
search path, capturing sub-token guesses and their associated probabilities.
Results reveal that higher resource languages benefit from higher likelihood of
the correct token being top-ranked, greater confidence, lower predictive
entropy, and more diverse alternative candidates. Lower resource languages fare
worse on these metrics, but also exhibit distinct clustering patterns in
sub-token usage sometimes influenced by typology in our PCA and t-SNE analysis.
This sub-token probing uncovers systematic decoding disparities masked by
aggregate error rates and points towards targeted interventions to ameliorate
the imbalanced development of speech technology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MixtureVitae是一个开源预训练语料库，采用风险缓解策略构建，结合公共领域和许可许可文本，在保持法律安全的同时提供强大的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在最小化法律风险，同时提供强大的模型性能，减少对无差别网络抓取的依赖。

Method: 采用多阶段管道进行许可证感知过滤、安全和质量筛选，结合公共领域、许可许可文本、政府作品和欧盟TDM合格来源，以及有针对性的指令、推理和合成数据。

Result: 在130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B参数的受控实验中，MixtureVitae训练的模型在标准基准测试中持续优于其他许可数据集，在1.7B/300B设置下接近DCLM性能，在数学/代码任务上表现特别强。

Conclusion: 许可优先、风险缓解的数据为训练有能力的LLM提供了实用且法律上缓解的基础，在不牺牲竞争力的同时减少对无差别网络抓取的依赖。

Abstract: We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize
legal risk while providing strong model performance. MixtureVitae follows a
risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively
licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions
(e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources), alongside targeted
instruction, reasoning and synthetic data with documented provenance. We detail
a transparent, multi-stage pipeline for license-aware filtering, safety and
quality screening, and domain-aware mixing, and we release the dataset and
curation recipes to support reproducible research. In controlled experiments
using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures at
130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B parameters; training budgets of 50B and 300B tokens),
models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive
datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B/300B setting
they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM in the later stages of training.
Performance is particularly strong on math/code and competitive on QA tasks.
These results demonstrate that permissive-first, risk-mitigated data provides a
practical and legally mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing
reliance on indiscriminate web scraping without sacrificing competitiveness.

### [11] [Calibrating Verbalized Confidence with Self-Generated Distractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25532)
*Victor Wang,Elias Stengel-Eskin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DINCO方法，通过评估LLM的易受暗示性来校准置信度估计，结合生成器-验证器不一致性和跨不兼容声明的连贯性来改善置信度校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的置信度分数通常存在校准问题，在低准确率实例上表现出过度自信，这损害了用户信任和安全性。研究发现这种过度自信源于LLM对信息量较少的声明具有更高的易受暗示性。

Method: 引入Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO)，通过让模型在多个自生成的干扰项上独立表达置信度，并基于总置信度进行归一化来估计和校正易受暗示性偏差。同时利用生成器-验证器不一致性，将归一化的验证器置信度与基于一致性的生成器置信度估计相结合。

Result: DINCO提供了更少饱和且更可用的置信度估计，在10次推理调用下优于100次调用的自一致性基线方法。分析表明仅通过增加采样无法消除DINCO与基线之间的差距。

Conclusion: DINCO通过整合跨采样的连贯性和跨不兼容声明的验证连贯性这两个互补维度，有效改善了LLM置信度校准，提供了更可靠和实用的置信度估计。

Abstract: Calibrated confidence estimates are necessary for large language model (LLM)
outputs to be trusted by human users. While LLMs can express their confidence
in human-interpretable ways, verbalized LLM-generated confidence scores have
empirically been found to be miscalibrated, reporting high confidence on
instances with low accuracy and thereby harming trust and safety. We
hypothesize that this overconfidence often stems from a given LLM's heightened
suggestibility when faced with claims that it encodes little information about;
we empirically validate this hypothesis, finding more suggestibility on
lower-accuracy claims. Building on this finding, we introduce
Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO), which estimates and accounts for an
LLM's suggestibility bias by having the model verbalize its confidence
independently across several self-generated distractors (i.e. alternative
claims), and normalizes by the total verbalized confidence. To further improve
calibration, we leverage generator-validator disagreement, augmenting
normalized validator confidence with a consistency-based estimate of generator
confidence. Here, we frame the popular approach of self-consistency as
leveraging coherence across sampled generations, and normalized verbalized
confidence as leveraging coherence across validations on incompatible claims,
allowing us to integrate these complementary dimensions of coherence into
DINCO. Moreover, our analysis shows that DINCO provides less saturated -- and
therefore more usable -- confidence estimates, and that further sampling alone
cannot close the gap between DINCO and baselines, with DINCO at 10 inference
calls outperforming self-consistency at 100.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自我奖励的评分标准强化学习框架，用于开放端推理任务，通过模型自身作为评分者生成基于评分标准的奖励信号，显著提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在HealthBench研究中发现，使用模型自身作为评分者并生成基于评分标准的奖励信号能大幅提升推理性能，且训练后的模型也成为更强的评分者。

Method: 引入自我奖励的评分标准强化学习框架，这是一种轻量级方法，支持更快、更资源高效的训练。仅使用4000样本的HealthBench Easy子集训练Qwen3-32B模型即可超越基线。

Result: 在Qwen3-32B上，仅使用4000样本的HealthBench Easy子集训练，获得的模型在HealthBench Hard上超过了GPT-5。加入少量教师评分数据可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 该框架在开放端推理任务中实现了显著的性能提升，同时保持了训练效率和资源节约。

Abstract: Open-ended evaluation is essential for deploying large language models in
real-world settings. In studying HealthBench, we observe that using the model
itself as a grader and generating rubric-based reward signals substantially
improves reasoning performance. Remarkably, the trained model also becomes a
stronger grader. Motivated by this, we introduce Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based
Reinforcement Learning for Open-Ended Reasoning, a lightweight framework that
enables faster and more resource-efficient training while surpassing baselines.
Remarkably, on Qwen3-32B, training with just the 4000-sample HealthBench Easy
subset is sufficient to obtain a model that exceeds GPT-5 on HealthBench Hard.
Incorporating a small amount of teacher-graded data further enhances
performance for less capable models.

TL;DR: PB-RLSVR是一个基于语义验证奖励的强化学习框架，通过使用高性能英语LLM作为枢轴模型生成参考响应，提升多语言推理能力，无需目标语言的人工标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习主要提升英语LLM的推理能力，导致不同语言间的性能差距显著，需要解决多语言推理能力不平衡的问题。

Method: 使用英语LLM作为枢轴模型生成参考响应，通过基于嵌入和机器翻译的跨语言语义奖励函数，奖励多语言模型与英语参考的语义等价性。

Result: 在多语言推理基准测试中显著缩小了英语与其他语言间的性能差距，Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen3-32B的平均多语言性能分别提升16.41%和10.17%。

Conclusion: PB-RLSVR提供了一种强大且数据高效的方法来构建真正的多语言推理代理，有效转移枢轴模型的推理能力到其他语言。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the reasoning abilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), these gains are largely confined to English, creating a
significant performance disparity across languages. To address this, we
introduce Pivot-Based Reinforcement Learning with Semantically Verifiable
Rewards (PB-RLSVR), a novel framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by
circumventing the need for human-annotated data in target languages. Our
approach employs a high-performing English LLM as a "pivot" model to generate
reference responses for reasoning tasks. A multilingual model is then rewarded
based on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the English reference,
effectively transferring the pivot model's reasoning capabilities across
languages. We investigate several cross-lingual semantic reward functions,
including those based on embeddings and machine translation. Extensive
experiments on a suite of multilingual reasoning benchmarks show that our
method significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other
languages, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines. Specifically,
our PB-RLSVR framework improves the average multilingual performance of
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B by 16.41% and 10.17%, respectively,
demonstrating a powerful and data-efficient approach to building truly
multilingual reasoning agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究儿童在4岁前频繁省略主语的空主语阶段现象，特别是儿童如何混淆祈使句空主语与陈述句，验证临时空主语语法假设

Method: 提出新的计算参数测量误解程度，使用改进的变分学习器（适用于超集-子集语言）模拟强制性主语语法学习过程

Result: 模拟结果支持Orfitelli和Hyams的假设，儿童确实会因表现影响而暂时采用空主语语法

Conclusion: 本研究为将计算模型整合到语法习得研究中提供了框架，同时考虑其他关键发展因素

Abstract: The empirically established null subject (NS) stage, lasting until about 4
years of age, involves frequent omission of subjects by children. Orfitelli and
Hyams (2012) observe that young English speakers often confuse imperative NS
utterances with declarative ones due to performance influences, promoting a
temporary null subject grammar. We propose a new computational parameter to
measure this misinterpretation and incorporate it into a simulated model of
obligatory subject grammar learning. Using a modified version of the
Variational Learner (Yang, 2012) which works for superset-subset languages, our
simulations support Orfitelli and Hyams' hypothesis. More generally, this study
outlines a framework for integrating computational models in the study of
grammatical acquisition alongside other key developmental factors.

TL;DR: 提出了Pairwise Difference Pearson (PDP)，一种用于机器翻译评估的段级元评估指标，通过使用成对差异而非原始分数来解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于Pearson's ρ和Kendall's τ的元评估方法在机器翻译评估中的局限性，提供更稳健的评分分布理解。

Method: PDP是一种基于相关性的指标，利用所有段的信息进行成对差异比较，将全局Pearson细化为段内分数比较。

Result: 在WMT'24共享任务中，PDP能正确排序评估指标，与人类错误权重更一致，且在噪声注入分析中表现出对随机噪声、段偏差和系统偏差的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PDP是一种有效的段级元评估指标，比现有方法更稳健，但对极端异常值敏感。

Abstract: This paper introduces Pairwise Difference Pearson (PDP), a novel
segment-level meta-evaluation metric for Machine Translation (MT) that address
limitations in previous Pearson's $\rho$-based and and Kendall's $\tau$-based
meta-evaluation approaches. PDP is a correlation-based metric that utilizes
pairwise differences rather than raw scores. It draws on information from all
segments for a more robust understanding of score distributions and uses
segment-wise pairwise differences to refine Global Pearson to intra-segment
score comparisons. Analysis on the WMT'24 shared task shows PDP properly ranks
sentinel evaluation metrics and better aligns with human error weightings than
previous work. Noise injection analysis demonstrates PDP's robustness to random
noise, segment bias, and system bias while highlighting its sensitivity to
extreme outliers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究小规模视觉语言模型在幽默和浪漫风格上的数据效率，探索用最少偏好数据实现风格对齐的性能极限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的视觉语言模型在零样本设置下难以生成特定风格（如幽默、浪漫）的图像描述，而获取偏好数据成本高昂，限制了模型能力的充分探索。

Method: 研究小规模视觉语言模型的数据效率，通过偏好数据对齐模型到幽默和浪漫风格，确定实现风格饱和所需的最少数据量。

Result: 定义了这些模型的性能极限，并确定了实现风格对齐所需的最小偏好数据量。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于基准测试视觉语言模型在风格化图像描述任务中的能力和局限性。

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly used to generate image captions in
specific styles, such as humor or romantic. However, these transformer-based
models often struggle with this subjective task in a zero-shot setting. While
preference data can be used to align them toward a desired style, such data is
expensive to acquire, limiting the ability to explore the models' full
capabilities. This work addresses this by studying the data efficiency of
aligning small vision-language models to humor and romantic styles. This
approach helps to define the performance limits of these models and determine
how little preference data is needed to achieve stylistic saturation,
benchmarking their capabilities and limitations.

*Tianlang Chen,Minkai Xu,Jure Leskovec,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RFG方法，无需显式过程奖励即可指导扩散大语言模型的推理轨迹，通过参数化过程奖励为增强模型和参考模型的似然比来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型在解决复杂问题时需要逐步指导推理过程，但传统方法需要为每个中间步骤进行密集标注，这在dLLMs中很困难，因为生成是任意顺序的且中间状态是部分掩码的句子。

Method: RFG通过参数化过程奖励为增强dLLM和参考dLLM的对数似然比来实现，增强模型可以通过现成的经过RL或SFT后训练的dLLM轻松获得。

Result: 在四个数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，RFG在所有任务和模型类型上都带来了显著改进，准确率提升高达9.2%。

Conclusion: RFG是一个通用的无需训练框架，可以在不依赖外部奖励模型的情况下扩展测试时推理能力。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown great potential in
large-scale language modeling, and there is an increasing interest in further
improving the capacity to solve complex problems by guiding the reasoning
process step by step. Common practice for autoregressive language models
typically learns a process reward model with dense annotation for each
intermediate step. However, this is challenging for dLLMs where the generation
is in an any-order fashion and intermediate states are partially masked
sentences. To this end, in this paper, we propose reward-free guidance (RFG), a
principled method for guiding the reasoning trajectory of dLLMs without
explicit process reward. The key idea of RFG is to parameterize the process
reward by log-likelihood ratios of the enhanced and reference dLLMs, where the
enhanced model can be easily obtained by any off-the-shelf dLLM that has been
post-trained with reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
We provide theoretical justification that RFG induces the reward-guided
sampling distribution with no additional reward. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on four challenging mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks using a diverse suite of dLLMs enhanced with various post-training
methods. RFG consistently yields significant improvements across all tasks and
model types, achieving accuracy gains of up to 9.2%. These findings establish
RFG as a general training-free framework that scales test-time reasoning
without reliance on external reward models.

*Takashi Furuya,Maarten V. de Hoop,Matti Lassas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer架构作为概率测度间映射的数学特性，证明了Transformer能够表示满足特定条件的测度间映射，并建立了与Vlasov方程解映射的联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了从数学上统一分析Transformer架构的表达能力，研究其处理任意大量上下文token的能力，以及作为概率测度间映射的性质。

Method: 将神经网络建模为概率测度上的映射，研究Transformer作为测度间映射的特性，分析其Fréchet导数的正则性条件。

Result: 完全刻画了能够通过Transformer表示的测度间映射的特性：保持支撑基数不变且Fréchet导数的正则部分一致连续。证明了Vlasov方程的解映射满足这些条件，因此可以被Transformer近似。

Conclusion: Transformer能够普遍近似任何具有连续上下文映射的表示，并且无限深度、平均场测度理论Transformer可以与Vlasov流等同起来。

Abstract: Transformers are deep architectures that define ``in-context maps'' which
enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt
in NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In previous
work, we studied the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily
large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly analyze their
expressivity, we considered the case that the mappings are conditioned on a
context represented by a probability distribution which becomes discrete for a
finite number of tokens. Modeling neural networks as maps on probability
measures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity,
proving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the
dynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work,
we study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We
fully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to
be represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand,
these include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally
approximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These
properties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part
of their Fr\'{e}chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that
the solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type,
for interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy
problem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be
approximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the
measure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the
infinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with
a Vlasov flow.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个大规模、实时的数据集和计算框架，用于系统性研究新闻媒体中的选择偏见和框架偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流新闻机构通过选择报道哪些话题以及如何框架议题来影响公众认知，但目前难以大规模测量这些微妙的媒体偏见形式。

Method: 整合大型语言模型与可扩展的近实时新闻抓取技术，提取包括政治倾向、语气、主题、文章类型和重大事件在内的结构化标注，每天处理数百篇文章。

Result: 开发了一个包含15万+文章的语料库，并在句子、文章和出版商多个层面量化了报道维度，同时发布了交互式网络平台供数据探索。

Conclusion: 建立了一个可重复使用的大规模媒体偏见研究方法，为未来研究提供实证资源，支持学术研究和改善媒体问责的实际努力。

Abstract: Mainstream news organizations shape public perception not only directly
through the articles they publish but also through the choices they make about
which topics to cover (or ignore) and how to frame the issues they do decide to
cover. However, measuring these subtle forms of media bias at scale remains a
challenge. Here, we introduce a large, ongoing (from January 1, 2024 to
present), near real-time dataset and computational framework developed to
enable systematic study of selection and framing bias in news coverage. Our
pipeline integrates large language models (LLMs) with scalable, near-real-time
news scraping to extract structured annotations -- including political lean,
tone, topics, article type, and major events -- across hundreds of articles per
day. We quantify these dimensions of coverage at multiple levels -- the
sentence level, the article level, and the publisher level -- expanding the
ways in which researchers can analyze media bias in the modern news landscape.
In addition to a curated dataset, we also release an interactive web platform
for convenient exploration of these data. Together, these contributions
establish a reusable methodology for studying media bias at scale, providing
empirical resources for future research. Leveraging the breadth of the corpus
over time and across publishers, we also present some examples (focused on the
150,000+ articles examined in 2024) that illustrate how this novel data set can
reveal insightful patterns in news coverage and bias, supporting academic
research and real-world efforts to improve media accountability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QFrBLiMP是一个包含1,761对魁北克法语最小对立对的语料库，用于评估LLMs在20种语法现象上的语言知识。研究发现模型能力随规模增长，但在需要深层语义理解的现象上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在魁北克法语语法现象上的语言知识，并与人类表现进行比较，揭示模型在特定语法任务上的局限性。

Method: 从魁北克政府官方资源中提取句子并手动修改创建最小对立对，由12名母语者标注语法性，通过比较模型对最小对中句子的概率分配来评估模型能力。

Result: 模型语法能力随规模增长，但所有模型在需要深层语义理解的现象上都表现失败，与人类表现存在显著差距。

Conclusion: LLMs在魁北克法语语法任务上显示出明显的层次化难度模式，深层语义理解是当前模型的关键限制因素。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Quebec-French Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal
Pairs (QFrBLiMP), a corpus designed to evaluate the linguistic knowledge of
LLMs on prominent grammatical phenomena in Quebec-French. QFrBLiMP consists of
1,761 minimal pairs annotated with 20 linguistic phenomena. Specifically, these
minimal pairs have been created by manually modifying sentences extracted from
an official online resource maintained by a Qu\'ebec government institution.
Each pair is annotated by twelve Quebec-French native speakers, who select the
sentence they feel is grammatical amongst the two. These annotations are used
to compare the competency of LLMs with that of humans. We evaluate different
LLMs on QFrBLiMP and MultiBLiMP-Fr by observing the rate of higher
probabilities assigned to the sentences of each minimal pair for each category.
We find that while grammatical competence scales with model size, a clear
hierarchy of difficulty emerges. All benchmarked models consistently fail on
phenomena requiring deep semantic understanding, revealing a critical
limitation and a significant gap compared to human performance on these
specific tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出基准和谐度概念，通过测量模型在基准测试各子领域性能的均匀分布程度来评估基准可靠性，发现不和谐的基准可能导致误导性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基准测试影响模型能力评估和开发方向，需要确保基准可靠性以实现可信评估和有意义进展。

Method: 从分布角度研究基准可靠性，引入基准和谐度指标，在19个多项选择基准和5个模型家族上进行实验，将基准映射到和谐度的均值-方差平面。

Result: 分析显示不和谐的基准可能给出误导结果，总体准确率可能被特定子领域不成比例地影响，如ARC-Easy被生物学概念问题主导。

Conclusion: 建议在报告准确率的同时报告和谐度，将评估从简单的性能平均值重构为更稳健、分布可靠的性能测量。

Abstract: Benchmarks shape scientific conclusions about model capabilities and steer
model development. This creates a feedback loop: stronger benchmarks drive
better models, and better models demand more discriminative benchmarks.
Ensuring benchmark reliability is therefore essential for trustworthy
evaluation and meaningful progress. In this work, we study benchmark
reliability from a distributional perspective and introduce benchmark harmony,
which measures how uniformly a model's performance is distributed across the
subdomains of a benchmark. We posit that high harmony is a desirable benchmark
property, indicating that the aggregate metric reflects uniform competence
across subdomains. Across 19 multiple-choice benchmarks and five model
families, we map each benchmark onto a mean-variance plane of harmony computed
across models, where high mean and low variance signal more reliable
evaluation. Our analysis shows that less harmonious benchmarks can give
misleading results, since overall accuracy may be disproportionately influenced
by specific subdomains. For instance, ARC-Easy is overwhelmed by questions on
Biological Concepts, overshadowing other critical subdomains such as Geography,
Physics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. By recommending that harmony
should be reported alongside accuracy, we reframe evaluation from simple
performance averages to a more robust, distributionally reliable measurement of
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiasUnlearn是一个新的模型去偏见框架，通过双路径遗忘机制协调刻板印象遗忘与反刻板印象保留，同时通过对抗性遗忘集和动态数据集交换防止偏见极性反转，在减轻语言模型偏见的同时保持语言建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数修改去偏见方法显著降低核心能力如文本连贯性和任务准确性，而基于提示的去偏见方法仅对预定义触发词有效，无法解决模型参数中深度嵌入的刻板印象关联。

Method: 提出BiasUnlearn框架，采用双路径遗忘机制协调刻板印象遗忘与反刻板印象保留，使用对抗性遗忘集和动态数据集交换防止偏见极性反转。

Result: 在多个语言模型和各种评估基准上的实验表明，BiasUnlearn在减轻语言模型偏见方面优于现有方法，同时保留语言建模能力。去偏见权重可在模型变体间迁移。

Conclusion: 偏见表示在预训练期间变得根深蒂固，并在微调阶段持续存在，BiasUnlearn通过有效的去偏见机制成功解决了这一问题。

Abstract: Many studies have shown various biases targeting different demographic groups
in language models, amplifying discrimination and harming fairness. Recent
parameter modification debiasing approaches significantly degrade core
capabilities such as text coherence and task accuracy. And Prompt-based
debiasing methods, only effective for predefined trigger words, fail to address
deeply embedded stereotypical associations in model parameters. In this paper,
we propose BiasUnlearn, a novel model debiasing framework which achieves
targeted debiasing via dual-pathway unlearning mechanisms coordinating
stereotype forgetting with anti-stereotype retention, while preventing bias
polarity reversal through adversarial forget set and dynamic dataset swapping.
We conducted extensive experiments with multiple language models across various
evaluation benchmarks. The results show that BiasUnlearn outperforms existing
methods in mitigating bias in language models while retaining language modeling
capabilities. Further experiments reveal that debiasing weights are
transferable across model variants, confirming that bias representations become
entrenched during pre-training and persist through fine-tuning phases.

TL;DR: LD-MoLE是一种可学习的动态路由机制，用于LoRA专家混合模型，通过可微分路由函数和闭式解替代传统的TopK选择，实现自适应、令牌相关和分层级的专家分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖传统的TopK路由，需要仔细的超参数调优，并为每个令牌分配固定数量的专家，这限制了模型的适应性和效率。

Method: 提出可学习的动态路由机制，使用可微分路由函数和闭式解替代非可微分的TopK选择，引入分析性稀疏控制目标来正则化激活专家数量，实现令牌相关和分层级的自适应专家分配。

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B和Llama-3.2-3B模型上的广泛实验表明，LD-MoLE在多样化基准测试中取得了最高的平均分数，优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: LD-MoLE不仅实现了优越的性能，还展示了学习令牌相关和分层级专家分配的能力，为参数高效微调与专家混合模型的结合提供了更灵活有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) with mixture-of-experts (MoE) is an effective strategy for adapting
large language models (LLMs) to the downstream tasks. However, most existing
approaches rely on conventional TopK routing, which requires careful
hyperparameter tuning and assigns a fixed number of experts to each token. In
this work, we propose LD-MoLE, a Learnable Dynamic routing mechanism for
Mixture of LoRA Experts that enables adaptive, token-dependent, and layer-wise
expert allocation. Our method replaces the non-differentiable TopK selection
with a differentiable routing function and a closed-form solution. Moreover,
our design allows the model to adaptively determine the number of experts to
activate for each token at different layers. In addition, we introduce an
analytical sparsity control objective to regularize the number of activated
experts. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3-1.7B and Llama-3.2-3B models show
that LD-MoLE achieves the highest average scores compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, across a diverse set of benchmarks. Our method not only achieves
superior performance, but also demonstrates the ability to learn
token-dependent and layer-wise expert allocation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型主要依赖扩大训练数据规模，但无法确定模型是否真正掌握了数学概念和推理原理，还是仅仅记忆训练数据。受人类将复杂问题分解为基本原子能力的启发，需要新的评估方法。

Method: 将原子能力分为两个维度：(1) 四大数学领域的特定能力：代数、几何、分析和拓扑；(2) 不同层次的逻辑能力：概念理解、前向多步推理、反例驱动的后向推理。为每个原子能力单元构建相应的训练和评估数据集。

Result: 在先进模型上的评估和实验结果显示，不同原子能力之间存在许多有趣的发现和启发，模型在各种原子能力上表现不同，原子能力之间存在相互作用。

Conclusion: 将数学智能解耦为原子组件具有重要意义，为模型认知提供新见解，并指导训练策略向更高效、可迁移和认知基础的"原子思维"范式发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in
mathematical reasoning capabilities. However, we argue that current large-scale
reasoning models primarily rely on scaling up training datasets with diverse
mathematical problems and long thinking chains, which raises questions about
whether LLMs genuinely acquire mathematical concepts and reasoning principles
or merely remember the training data. In contrast, humans tend to break down
complex problems into multiple fundamental atomic capabilities. Inspired by
this, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating mathematical atomic
capabilities. Our work categorizes atomic abilities into two dimensions: (1)
field-specific abilities across four major mathematical fields, algebra,
geometry, analysis, and topology, and (2) logical abilities at different
levels, including conceptual understanding, forward multi-step reasoning with
formal math language, and counterexample-driven backward reasoning. We propose
corresponding training and evaluation datasets for each atomic capability unit,
and conduct extensive experiments about how different atomic capabilities
influence others, to explore the strategies to elicit the required specific
atomic capability. Evaluation and experimental results on advanced models show
many interesting discoveries and inspirations about the different performances
of models on various atomic capabilities and the interactions between atomic
capabilities. Our findings highlight the importance of decoupling mathematical
intelligence into atomic components, providing new insights into model
cognition and guiding the development of training strategies toward a more
efficient, transferable, and cognitively grounded paradigm of "atomic
thinking".

Motivation: 在医疗、社会服务和法律等高风险领域，文本匿名化对于负责任地开发和部署AI至关重要，需要平衡隐私保护与数据实用性。

Method: 使用实体感知控制代码引导可控生成，支持上下文学习(ICL)和前缀调优两种方式。ICL变体确保与基础去识别系统一致的隐私级别，前缀调优变体采用自定义掩码策略和损失函数支持可扩展的高质量生成。

Conclusion: 该方法为敏感领域的合成文本生成提供了一个实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text anonymization is essential for responsibly developing and deploying AI
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, social services, and law. In this
work, we propose a novel methodology for privacy-preserving synthetic text
generation that leverages the principles of de-identification and the Hiding In
Plain Sight (HIPS) theory. Our approach introduces entity-aware control codes
to guide controllable generation using either in-context learning (ICL) or
prefix tuning. The ICL variant ensures privacy levels consistent with the
underlying de-identification system, while the prefix tuning variant
incorporates a custom masking strategy and loss function to support scalable,
high-quality generation. Experiments on legal and clinical datasets demonstrate
that our method achieves a strong balance between privacy protection and
utility, offering a practical and effective solution for synthetic text
generation in sensitive domains.

Method: CATCH框架包含渐进式对话合成策略（提取目标、资源、解决方案并组织成结构化大纲）和记忆驱动动态规划思维模式（整合记忆增强、全局规划和策略推理）

Result: 广泛的实验和人工评估表明，CATCH显著提升了AI心理咨询的保真度和逻辑连贯性

Conclusion: CATCH框架有效解决了现有AI心理咨询方法在保真度和决策逻辑方面的局限性

Abstract: Recently, advancements in AI counseling based on large language models have
shown significant progress. However, existing studies employ a one-time
generation approach to synthesize multi-turn dialogue samples, resulting in low
therapy fidelity and failing to capture the decision-making rationale behind
each response. In this work, we propose CATCH, a novel data synthesis framework
designed to address these challenges. Specifically, to improve therapy
fidelity, we introduce the Progressive Dialogue Synthesis strategy, which
extracts goals, resources, and solutions from a client's self-report, organizes
them into structured outlines, and then incrementally generates stage-aligned
counseling dialogues. To capture decision-making rationale behind each
response, we propose the Memory-Driven Dynamic Planning thinking pattern that
integrates memory enhancement, global planning, and strategy reasoning; a
collaborative multi-agent optimizer then leverages MDP to attach explicit
chain-of-thought to each dialogue turn. Extensive experiments and human
evaluations demonstrate that CATCH significantly enhances fidelity and logical
coherence in AI counseling.

Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale,
high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However,
generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming
particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting,
where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual
understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented
pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in
structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever,
base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using
documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data
quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality
samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario
focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline
generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human
intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and
reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing
dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.

Abstract: The detection of hopeful speech in social media has emerged as a critical
task for promoting positive discourse and well-being. In this paper, we present
a machine learning approach to multiclass hope speech detection across multiple

Motivation: 现有方法在优化准确性时会放大幻觉，而鼓励弃权的方法又过于保守，牺牲正确答案。这两种极端都会损害真实性。

Method: 使用GRPO实现TruthRL，采用三元奖励机制区分正确答案、幻觉和弃权，激励模型不仅提供正确回答，还能在不确定时弃权。

Result: 在四个知识密集型基准测试中，TruthRL相比普通RL显著减少幻觉28.9%，提高真实性21.1%，在各种骨干模型下表现一致。

Conclusion: TruthRL在准确性和真实性方面都表现出色，强调了学习目标设计对于开发真实LLMs的重要性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on
factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and
untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their
parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy --
models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid
hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:
approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those
that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct
answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we
present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly
optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using
GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct
answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce
hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling
abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive
experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to
vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves
truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models
(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth
ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as
supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual
correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven
TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness,
underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing
truthful LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究比较了基于深度神经网络(DNN)的嵌入模型和大型语言模型(LLMs)在抑郁症检测中的算法偏见，重点关注性别和种族/民族方面的公平性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是调查语言模型在抑郁症自动检测中的算法偏见问题，特别关注不同社会人口群体(性别、种族/民族)之间的公平性差异。

Method: 使用DAIC-WOZ临床访谈数据，比较DNN嵌入模型和LLMs的少样本学习方法。对DNN模型应用公平性感知损失函数，对LLMs探索不同提示框架和样本数量的上下文学习。

Result: LLMs在抑郁症分类中表现优于DNN模型，特别是在西班牙裔参与者等代表性不足群体中。LLMs的性别偏见较小，但种族差异仍然存在。在DNN模型中，最差群体损失方法在性能和公平性之间取得更好平衡。

Conclusion: LLMs在抑郁症检测中表现更好且性别偏见较小，但种族偏见问题仍然存在。公平性感知技术对DNN模型有效，而LLMs中增加样本数量并不能有效减少种族差异。

Abstract: This paper investigates algorithmic bias in language-based models for
automated depression detection, focusing on socio-demographic disparities
related to gender and race/ethnicity. Models trained using deep neural networks
(DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large
language models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical
interview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz
(DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to
DNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot
counts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based
models in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups
such as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared
to DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among
fairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the
worst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing
demographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness.
In contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but
performs less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps
mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of
shots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity,
neither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively
reduces disparities.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
their performance in domain-specific applications and non-English languages
remains less explored. This study introduces a novel Romanian-language dataset
for multiple-choice biology questions, carefully curated to assess LLM
comprehension and reasoning capabilities in scientific contexts. Containing
approximately 14,000 questions, the dataset provides a comprehensive resource

  We benchmark several popular LLMs, analyzing their accuracy, reasoning
patterns, and ability to understand domain-specific terminology and linguistic
nuances. Additionally, we perform comprehensive experiments to evaluate the
impact of prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and other optimization techniques on
model performance. Our findings highlight both the strengths and limitations of
current LLMs in handling specialized knowledge tasks in low-resource languages,
offering valuable insights for future research and development.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图基方法缺乏检索机制、主题特异性，且推理成本高，无法有效处理需要从整个语料库综合信息的全局语义理解任务。

Method: ReTAG是一个检索增强、主题增强的图框架，构建主题特定子图并检索相关摘要用于回答生成。

Result: 实验表明ReTAG相比基线方法提高了回答质量，同时显著减少了推理时间。

Conclusion: ReTAG框架有效解决了全局语义理解中的关键挑战，在质量和效率方面都有显著改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in question answering have led to substantial progress in
tasks such as multi-hop reasoning. However, global sensemaking-answering
questions by synthesizing information from an entire corpus remains a
significant challenge. A prior graph-based approach to global sensemaking lacks
retrieval mechanisms, topic specificity, and incurs high inference costs. To
address these limitations, we propose ReTAG, a Retrieval-Enhanced,
Topic-Augmented Graph framework that constructs topic-specific subgraphs and
retrieves the relevant summaries for response generation. Experiments show that
ReTAG improves response quality while significantly reducing inference time
compared to the baseline. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RLVR的大规模推理模型存在"过度思考"问题，生成过长推理路径但无性能提升。现有长度惩罚方法因轨迹级奖励与token级优化的不匹配而失败。

Method: 提出DECS框架：1) 首创解耦token级奖励机制，精准惩罚冗余token；2) 新颖的课程批量调度策略，平衡效率与效果。

Result: 在7个基准测试中，推理token数量减少超过50%，同时保持甚至提升了性能表现。

Conclusion: DECS证明可以在不损害模型推理能力的前提下，实现推理效率的大幅提升。

Abstract: While large reasoning models trained with critic-free reinforcement learning
and verifiable rewards (RLVR) represent the state-of-the-art, their practical
utility is hampered by ``overthinking'', a critical issue where models generate
excessively long reasoning paths without any performance benefit. Existing
solutions that penalize length often fail, inducing performance degradation due
to a fundamental misalignment between trajectory-level rewards and token-level
optimization. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, DECS, built on our
theoretical discovery of two previously unaddressed flaws in current length
rewards: (1) the erroneous penalization of essential exploratory tokens and (2)
the inadvertent rewarding of partial redundancy. Our framework's innovations
include (i) a first-of-its-kind decoupled token-level reward mechanism that
surgically distinguishes and penalizes redundant tokens, and (ii) a novel
curriculum batch scheduling strategy to master the efficiency-efficacy
equilibrium. Experimental results show DECS can achieve a dramatic reduction in
reasoning tokens by over 50\% across seven benchmarks while simultaneously
maintaining or even improving performance. It demonstrates conclusively that
substantial gains in reasoning efficiency can be achieved without compromising
a model's underlying reasoning power.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出两种视觉语言模型解释质量评分函数——视觉保真度和对比性，以帮助用户在无法看到视觉上下文时判断模型预测的可靠性，并通过用户研究验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当用户无法看到视觉上下文时（如视障用户），VLM生成的解释可能误导用户相信不准确的预测。需要解决用户对VLM预测的过度依赖问题。

Method: 提出两种解释质量评分函数：视觉保真度（衡量解释对视觉上下文的忠实度）和对比性（衡量解释区分模型预测与替代方案的能力）。在A-OKVQA和VizWiz任务上进行评估，并进行用户研究。

Result: 提出的质量评分函数比现有解释质量指标与模型正确性更相关。用户研究中，显示质量评分可将用户预测VLM正确性的准确率提高11.1%，错误相信不正确预测的比例降低15.4%。

Conclusion: 解释质量评分有助于促进用户对VLM预测的适当依赖，特别是在无法看到视觉上下文的情况下。

Abstract: When people query Vision-Language Models (VLMs) but cannot see the
accompanying visual context (e.g. for blind and low-vision users), augmenting
VLM predictions with natural language explanations can signal which model
predictions are reliable. However, prior work has found that explanations can
easily convince users that inaccurate VLM predictions are correct. To remedy
undesirable overreliance on VLM predictions, we propose evaluating two
complementary qualities of VLM-generated explanations via two quality scoring
functions. We propose Visual Fidelity, which captures how faithful an
explanation is to the visual context, and Contrastiveness, which captures how
well the explanation identifies visual details that distinguish the model's
prediction from plausible alternatives. On the A-OKVQA and VizWiz tasks, these
quality scoring functions are better calibrated with model correctness than
existing explanation qualities. We conduct a user study in which participants
have to decide whether a VLM prediction is accurate without viewing its visual
context. We observe that showing our quality scores alongside VLM explanations
improves participants' accuracy at predicting VLM correctness by 11.1%,
including a 15.4% reduction in the rate of falsely believing incorrect
predictions. These findings highlight the utility of explanation quality scores
in fostering appropriate reliance on VLM predictions.

Motivation: 大语言模型经常虚构科学事实，严重影响其可信度，需要超越二元事实性评估的细粒度基准。

Method: 构建包含正确和虚构科学答案的问答对数据集，标注精确的错误范围和错误类型，支持虚构检测、错误定位和修正的三阶段评估。

Result: 测试9个最先进的大语言模型，发现性能有限（约50%准确率），即使是GPT-4o也难以区分事实性科学答案和虚构答案。

Conclusion: 需要细粒度、人工验证的基准来检测和修正领域特定上下文中的科学虚构，对LLM-as-judge评估范式的可靠性提出质疑。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently confabulate scientific facts,severely
undermining their trustworthiness. Addressing this challenge requires
benchmarks that go beyond binary factuality and enable fine-grained evaluation.
We introduce \textbf{ReFACT} (\textit{Reddit False And Correct Texts}), a
benchmark of 1,001 expert-annotated question--answer pairs spanning diverse
scientific domains for the detection of scientific confabulation. Each instance
includes both a scientifically correct answer and a non-factual counterpart
annotated with \textbf{precise error spans and error-types}. ReFACT enables
multi-stage evaluation: (1) confabulation detection, (2) fine-grained error
localization, and (3) correction. We benchmark 9 state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing limited performance ($\sim$50\% accuracy). Even top models such as
GPT-4o fail to distinguish factual from confabulated scientific answers,
raising concerns about the reliability of \textit{LLM-as-judge} evaluation

clean conditions, their effectiveness in noisy environments remains unclear. To
address this, we experiment with multiple training strategies, including
synthetic noise augmentation and SpecAugment, and evaluate performance across a

training substantially improves robustness, particularly for larger Whisper

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在人类决策中影响力增强，需要理解它们在复杂社会情境中的行为，特别是角色冲突这种需要上下文敏感性的模糊社会困境

Method: 使用三阶段流水线生成超过13K个现实角色冲突场景，涵盖65个角色，系统性地改变期望责任和情境紧急程度，分析10个不同LLM的模型选择

Result: LLM对上下文线索有一定响应能力但不足够，决策主要受社会角色固有偏见主导，表现出对家庭和职业领域角色的偏好，以及男性角色和亚伯拉罕宗教的优先选择

Conclusion: LLM在角色冲突情境中的上下文敏感性不足，其决策受到强大的社会角色偏见影响，这揭示了LLM在复杂社会推理方面的局限性

Abstract: Humans often encounter role conflicts -- social dilemmas where the
expectations of multiple roles clash and cannot be simultaneously fulfilled. As
large language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human
decision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is
essential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in
contexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently
ambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to
recognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter
decision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a
novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex
social dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over
13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying
their associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations)
and situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different
LLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual
cues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are
predominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles
rather than situational information. Our analysis quantifies these biases,
revealing a dominant preference for roles within the Family and Occupation
domains, as well as a clear prioritization of male roles and Abrahamic
religions across most evaluatee models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏评估文本个性化质量的专门指标，研究者通常依赖多个大语言模型进行元评估，但这种方法成本高昂且受模型内部偏见影响

Method: 开发了PerQ方法，一种计算效率高的文本个性化质量评估指标

Result: 通过大型和小型语言模型生成能力的案例研究，证明了PerQ指标在研究中具有实用性

Conclusion: PerQ方法能有效减少资源浪费，为文本个性化质量评估提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Since no metrics are available to evaluate specific aspects of a text, such
as its personalization quality, the researchers often rely solely on large
language models to meta-evaluate such texts. Due to internal biases of
individual language models, it is recommended to use multiple of them for
combined evaluation, which directly increases costs of such meta-evaluation. In
this paper, a computationally efficient method for evaluation of
personalization quality of a given text (generated by a language model) is
introduced, called PerQ. A case study of comparison of generation capabilities
of large and small language models shows the usability of the proposed metric
in research, effectively reducing the waste of resources.

Method: 使用强化学习框架训练代理，构建专门训练数据集涵盖多样多轮交互模式，代理处理顺序信息块学习提取存储相关内容并更新记忆系统，奖励信号来自下游问答准确性

Result: Mem-alpha相比现有记忆增强代理基线取得显著改进，在仅用3万token训练的情况下，能泛化到超过40万token的序列，超过训练长度的13倍

Conclusion: Mem-alpha框架能有效训练代理管理复杂记忆系统，展示了在长序列任务中的强大泛化能力，为记忆增强代理提供了新的训练范式

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are constrained by limited context windows,
necessitating external memory systems for long-term information understanding.
Current memory-augmented agents typically depend on pre-defined instructions
and tools for memory updates. However, language models may lack the ability to
determine which information to store, how to structure it, and when to update
it, especially as memory systems become more complex. This results in
suboptimal memory construction and information loss. To this end, we propose
Mem-alpha, a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to effectively
manage complex memory systems through interaction and feedback. We also
construct a specialized training dataset spanning diverse multi-turn
interaction patterns paired with comprehensive evaluation questions designed to
teach effective memory management. During training, agents process sequential
information chunks, learn to extract and store relevant content, then update
the memory system. The reward signal derives from downstream question-answering
accuracy over the full interaction history, directly optimizing for memory
construction. To illustrate the effectiveness of our training framework, we
design a memory architecture comprising core, episodic, and semantic
components, equipped with multiple tools for memory operations. Empirical
evaluation demonstrates that Mem-alpha achieves significant improvements over
existing memory-augmented agent baselines. Despite being trained exclusively on
instances with a maximum length of 30k tokens, our agents exhibit remarkable
generalization to sequences exceeding 400k tokens, over 13x the training
length, highlighting the robustness of Mem-alpha.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的MoE路由器函数KERN，替代传统的Softmax，基于Nadaraya-Watson回归的数学框架，无需额外计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型一直使用Softmax作为路由器函数，但这种选择缺乏理论依据。作者发现MoE与Nadaraya-Watson回归具有相同数学形式，这为设计新的路由器函数提供了理论基础。

Method: 提出KERN路由器函数，基于FFN风格设计，使用ReLU激活和l2归一化，能够泛化Sigmoid和Softmax路由器，且无需额外计算成本。

Result: 在MoE和LLM上的综合实验验证了所提出的FFN风格路由器函数的有效性。

Conclusion: KERN路由器为MoE模型提供了更理论依据的路由器选择，能够替代传统的Softmax函数，并在实验中表现出良好效果。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a cornerstone in recent state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, MoE relies on $\mathrm{Softmax}$
as the router score function to aggregate expert output, a designed choice that
has persisted from the earliest MoE models to modern LLMs, and is now widely
regarded as standard practice. However, the necessity of using
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ to project router weights into a probability simplex remains
an unchallenged assumption rather than a principled design choice. In this
work, we first revisit the classical Nadaraya-Watson regression and observe
that MoE shares the same mathematical formulation as Nadaraya-Watson
regression. Furthermore, we show that both feed-forward neural network (FFN)
and MoE can be interpreted as a special case of Nadaraya-Watson regression,
where the kernel function corresponds to the input neurons of the output layer.
Motivated by these insights, we propose the \textbf{zero-additional-cost}
Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization (KERN), an FFN-style router function,
as an alternative to $\mathrm{Softmax}$. We demonstrate that this router
generalizes both $\mathrm{Sigmoid}$- and $\mathrm{Softmax}$-based routers.
\textbf{Based on empirical observations and established practices in FFN
implementation, we recommend the use of $\mathrm{ReLU}$ activation and
$\ell_2$-normalization in $\mathrm{KERN}$ router function.} Comprehensive
experiments in MoE and LLM validate the effectiveness of the proposed FFN-style
router function \methodNorm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer编码器在序列标注中占主导地位，但一些替代架构在语言建模中显示出潜力，然而这些架构在序列标注任务中的应用较少，特别是在复杂结构化任务中。

Method: 研究了xLSTMs、结构化状态空间模型、扩散模型和对抗学习等架构在不同结构复杂性、标签空间和token依赖关系的标注任务上的适应性，并在多语言环境中进行评估。

Result: 发现在简单设置中观察到的强性能并不总是能很好地跨语言或跨数据集泛化，也无法扩展到更复杂的结构化任务。

Conclusion: 替代架构在序列标注任务中的表现受到任务复杂性和语言多样性的限制，其泛化能力不如预期。

Abstract: Pretrained Transformer encoders are the dominant approach to sequence
labeling. While some alternative architectures-such as xLSTMs, structured
state-space models, diffusion models, and adversarial learning-have shown
promise in language modeling, few have been applied to sequence labeling, and
mostly on flat or simplified tasks. We study how these architectures adapt
across tagging tasks that vary in structural complexity, label space, and token
dependencies, with evaluation spanning multiple languages. We find that the
strong performance previously observed in simpler settings does not always
generalize well across languages or datasets, nor does it extend to more
complex structured tasks.

Method: 提出了针对四种无参考评估指标的对抗攻击策略，并开发了相应的对抗系统来攻击这些指标。

Result: 实验证明，所提出的对抗系统在攻击效果上超越了当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了需要开发更鲁棒的评估方法，以应对潜在的对抗攻击威胁。

Abstract: Reference-free evaluation metrics for grammatical error correction (GEC) have
achieved high correlation with human judgments. However, these metrics are not
designed to evaluate adversarial systems that aim to obtain unjustifiably high
scores. The existence of such systems undermines the reliability of automatic
evaluation, as it can mislead users in selecting appropriate GEC systems. In
this study, we propose adversarial attack strategies for four reference-free

our adversarial systems outperform the current state-of-the-art. These findings
highlight the need for more robust evaluation methods.

Motivation: 现有奖励模型基于通用偏好数据训练，在RAG场景中难以准确评估回答的忠实性、相关性、拒绝能力、完整性和简洁性，缺乏专门的RAG偏好数据集和模型。

Method: 提出RAGferee方法，将问答数据集重新构建为偏好对，强调基于检索内容的真实性而非风格特征，训练参数规模从7B到24B的上下文奖励模型。

Result: 在ContextualJudgeBench上达到最先进性能，超越基于更大通用数据集（最多240万样本）训练的70B+模型，绝对改进达+15.5%。

Conclusion: RAGferee方法能有效训练专门针对RAG场景的奖励模型，小规模高质量数据集训练的小模型可以超越大规模通用数据集训练的大模型。

Abstract: Existing Reward Models (RMs), typically trained on general preference data,
struggle in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which require
judging responses for faithfulness to retrieved context, relevance to the user
query, appropriate refusals when context is insufficient, completeness and
conciseness of information. To address the lack of publicly available
RAG-centric preference datasets and specialised RMs, we introduce RAGferee, a
methodology that repurposes question-answering (QA) datasets into preference
pairs that prioritise groundedness over stylistic features, enabling the
training of contextual RMs better suited to judging RAG responses. Using
RAGferee, we curate a small preference dataset of 4K samples and fine-tune RMs
ranging from 7B to 24B parameters. Our RAG-centric RMs achieve state-of-the-art
performance on ContextualJudgeBench, surpassing existing 70B+ RMs trained on
much larger (up to 2.4M samples) general corpora, with an absolute improvement
of +15.5%.

*Baoxin Wang,Yumeng Luo,Yixuan Wang,Dayong Wu,Wanxiang Che,Shijin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RE²方法，通过语法错误解释而非文本相似度来检索参考示例，提升中文语法纠错性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖文本相似度检索示例，但这种方法经常与实际错误模式不匹配，检索到词汇相似但语法无关的句子

Method: RE²方法使用语法错误解释来选择参考示例，创建了高质量的语法错误解释数据集，并用LLMs提升CGEC性能

Result: 在两个CGEC数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法有效提升了中文语法纠错的性能

Conclusion: 基于语法错误解释的示例检索方法比基于文本相似度的方法更有效，为CGEC和GEE研究提供了有价值的资源

Abstract: The primary objective of Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) is to
detect and correct errors in Chinese sentences. Recent research shows that
large language models (LLMs) have been applied to CGEC with significant
results. For LLMs, selecting appropriate reference examples can help improve
their performance. However, existing methods predominantly rely on text
similarity for example retrieval, a strategy that frequently mismatches actual
error patterns and retrieves lexically similar yet grammatically irrelevant
sentences. To address this problem, we propose a method named RE$^2$, which
retrieves appropriate examples with explanations of grammatical errors. Instead
of using text similarity of the input sentence, we use explanations of
grammatical errors to select reference examples, which are used by LLMs to
improve the performance of CGEC. We conduct experiments on two CGEC datasets
and create a high-quality grammatical error explanation (GEE) dataset, which is
not only used in our research but also serves as a valuable resource for future
studies in both CGEC and GEE. The experimental results on the two datasets
indicate that our proposed method effectively improves the performance of CGEC.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了大型语言模型在思维链提示下的忠实性问题，通过控制提示中的线索操纵，发现模型推理严重依赖提示中的捷径线索，而非真正的计算过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究思维链生成的推理过程在多大程度上忠实于底层计算，而非受提示中嵌入的答案捷径线索影响的后验叙述。

Method: 在四个数据集上使用两个先进模型，通过系统操纵线索的正确性、呈现风格和复杂度，评估任务准确性和线索在推理中的显式承认情况。

Result: 正确线索显著提高准确性，错误线索降低准确性；复杂线索更易被显式承认，简单线索常被默默采用；呈现风格影响承认行为，奉承风格鼓励显式承认，泄露风格促进隐藏依赖。

Conclusion: LLM推理系统性地受到提示中捷径线索的影响，这掩盖了推理过程的忠实性，揭示了模型可能更依赖提示线索而非真正的推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central
question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful}
to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints
that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work
on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT
faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans
four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models
(GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in
correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data
leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator
expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly
acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First,
correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks
and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks
with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly
uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are
often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward
verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style
matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style
prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect
RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data
leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that
LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure
faithfulness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出RE-Searcher方法，通过目标导向规划和自我反思来增强LLM搜索代理在复杂搜索环境中的鲁棒性，解决查询变化导致的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在知识问答方面表现出色，但受限于知识截止、幻觉和交互模式限制。虽然外部搜索工具可以缓解这些问题，但复杂搜索环境中查询的微小变化会导致推理偏离正确轨迹并放大错误。

Method: 提出RE-Searcher方法：在搜索过程中明确表达具体搜索目标，然后反思检索到的证据是否满足该目标。结合目标导向规划和自我反思来抵抗复杂环境中的虚假线索。

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了搜索准确性并达到最先进结果。扰动研究进一步证明了对噪声或误导性外部信号的强大韧性，缓解了搜索过程的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为将LLM驱动的代理集成到更复杂的交互环境中并实现更自主的决策提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive question answering
and reasoning, yet their real-world deployment remains constrained by knowledge
cutoff, hallucination, and limited interaction modalities. Augmenting LLMs with
external search tools helps alleviate these issues, but it also exposes agents
to a complex search environment in which small, plausible variations in query
formulation can steer reasoning into unproductive trajectories and amplify
errors. We present a systematic analysis that quantifies how environmental
complexity induces fragile search behaviors and, in turn, degrades overall
performance. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective
approach to instantiate a search agent, RE-Searcher. During search, RE-Searcher
explicitly articulates a concrete search goal and subsequently reflects on
whether the retrieved evidence satisfies that goal. This combination of
goal-oriented planning and self-reflection enables RE-Searcher to resist
spurious cues in complex search environments and perform robust search.
Extensive experiments show that our method improves search accuracy and
achieves state-of-the-art results. Perturbation studies further demonstrate
substantial resilience to noisy or misleading external signals, mitigating the
fragility of the search process. We believe these findings offer practical
guidance for integrating LLM-powered agents into more complex interactive
environments and enabling more autonomous decision-making.

TL;DR: 该论文填补了中欧语言机器生成文本检测的空白，建立了首个专注于该地区的检测方法基准，并比较了不同训练语言组合的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器生成文本检测研究主要集中于英语，使得现有检测器几乎无法用于非英语语言，特别是中欧语言的研究较少，跨语言迁移能力未被充分探索。

Method: 通过多领域、多生成器和多语言评估，比较不同训练语言组合的性能，并测试检测方法在对抗性攻击下的鲁棒性。

Result: 在中欧语言上进行监督微调的检测器在这些语言上表现最佳，并且对混淆攻击具有最强的抵抗力。

Conclusion: 针对特定语言进行监督微调的检测器在中欧语言上表现最优，且具有最强的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Machine-generated text detection, as an important task, is predominantly
focused on English in research. This makes the existing detectors almost
unusable for non-English languages, relying purely on cross-lingual
transferability. There exist only a few works focused on any of Central
European languages, leaving the transferability towards these languages rather
unexplored. We fill this gap by providing the first benchmark of detection
methods focused on this region, while also providing comparison of
train-languages combinations to identify the best performing ones. We focus on
multi-domain, multi-generator, and multilingual evaluation, pinpointing the
differences of individual aspects, as well as adversarial robustness of
detection methods. Supervised finetuned detectors in the Central European
languages are found the most performant in these languages as well as the most
resistant against obfuscation.

*Yanbo Wang,Zixiang Xu,Yue Huang,Xiangqi Wang,Zirui Song,Lang Gao,Chenxi Wang,Xiangru Tang,Yue Zhao,Arman Cohan,Xiangliang Zhang,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DyFlow是一个动态工作流生成框架，通过自适应构建和调整推理过程来增强跨任务泛化能力，显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的智能体系统大多依赖手动设计的工作流程，限制了跨任务的适应性。虽然少数方法尝试自动生成工作流，但通常与特定数据集或查询类型绑定，且对中间反馈利用有限，导致系统鲁棒性和推理深度不足。

Method: DyFlow包含两个核心组件：设计器和执行器。设计器将复杂问题分解为一系列由高级目标定义的子目标，并根据中间输出和反馈动态规划下一步骤。执行器使用具有上下文感知参数化的动态操作符来执行每个操作，实现灵活且语义基础的推理。

Result: 在社交推理、生物医学任务、数学问题解决和代码生成等多个领域进行的系统评估表明，DyFlow显著优于现有基线方法，实现了Pass@k指标的显著提升，并在不同领域展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DyFlow通过动态工作流生成和自适应调整，有效解决了现有方法在跨任务泛化和推理深度方面的局限性，为构建更高效和通用的智能体系统提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) have shown great
potential in complex reasoning tasks, but building efficient and generalizable
workflows remains a major challenge. Most existing approaches rely on manually
designed processes, which limits their adaptability across different tasks.
While a few methods attempt automated workflow generation, they are often tied
to specific datasets or query types and make limited use of intermediate
feedback, reducing system robustness and reasoning depth. Moreover, their
operations are typically predefined and inflexible. To address these
limitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that
adaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task
requirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task
generalization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an
executor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals
defined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on
intermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the
executor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with
context-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded
reasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including
social reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code
generation. Results demonstrate that DyFlow significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving substantial Pass@k improvements and exhibiting robust
generalization across diverse domains. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/wyf23187/DyFlow.

*Arash Marioriyad,Mohammad Hossein Rohban,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 当前LLM评估器存在捷径偏差，会基于提示中的表面线索（如来源和时间）而非内容质量做出判断，且极少承认这些偏差因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM作为自动评估器在评估系统输出时的忠实性，检验其是否仅基于响应质量进行判断并明确承认决策因素。

Method: 使用ELI5和LitBench数据集构建100对比较任务，让GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5-Flash作为评估器，在保持提示固定的情况下为响应分配来源线索（Human、Expert、LLM、Unknown）和时间线索（Old、New）。

Result: 两个模型都表现出强烈的时间偏差（偏向新响应）和来源层次偏差（Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown），这些偏差在GPT-4o和LitBench领域尤为明显，且极少在理由中承认这些线索。

Conclusion: 当前LLM-as-a-judge系统容易受捷径影响且不忠实，削弱了其在研究和部署中作为评估器的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to
evaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative
writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality
and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that
current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in
the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for
long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative
writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must
choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100
pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and
Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair,
we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source
identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal
origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed.
Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency
bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear
provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are
especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended
LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost
never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of
content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge
systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as
evaluators in both research and deployment.

TL;DR: 提出LENS框架，在LLM的潜在嵌入空间中直接合成偏好数据，避免昂贵的文本生成和标注，比基于文本的增强方法快18倍且模型小16000倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励建模对对齐LLM与人类偏好至关重要，但偏好数据的高成本成为瓶颈。现有文本数据合成方法计算成本高。

Method: 使用变分自编码器(VAE)学习响应嵌入的结构化潜在表示，在潜在空间中进行受控扰动并解码回嵌入空间，生成多样且语义一致的合成偏好对。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，潜在空间合成显著优于基于文本的增强方法，获得更优结果，同时生成速度快18倍，使用模型小16000倍。

Conclusion: LENS为通过高效数据增强改进奖励建模提供了可扩展且有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Reward modeling, crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human
preferences, is often bottlenecked by the high cost of preference data.
Existing textual data synthesis methods are computationally expensive. We
propose a novel framework LENS for synthesizing preference data directly in the
LLM's latent embedding space. Our method employs a Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to learn a structured latent representation of response embeddings. By
performing controlled perturbations in this latent space and decoding back to
the embedding space, we efficiently generate diverse, semantically consistent
synthetic preference pairs, bypassing costly text generation and annotation. We
provide theoretical guarantees that our synthesized pairs approximately
preserve original preference ordering and improve reward model generalization.
Empirically, our latent-space synthesis significantly outperforms text-based
augmentation on standard benchmarks, achieving superior results while being 18x
faster in generation and using a 16,000x smaller model. Our work offers a
scalable and effective alternative for enhancing reward modeling through
efficient data augmentation. Code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有基准测试局限于最终答案问题或高中数学竞赛题，无法评估LLM在研究生水平数学研究任务上的能力。

Method: 创建包含39个同行评审问题的私有基准，每个问题需要详细证明并配有子问题，在模拟研究环境的代理框架中评估模型，使用网络搜索和数学软件等工具。

Result: 当前LLM在较易的研究级问题上表现良好，但在更具挑战性的问题上仍有困难。Grok-4在最终答案子问题上准确率最高（52%），GPT-5在证明生成方面表现最佳（22%问题完全正确）。

Conclusion: IMProofBench将作为动态基准与数学社区合作持续发展，确保其相关性以评估下一代LLM。

Abstract: As the mathematical capabilities of large language models (LLMs) improve, it
becomes increasingly important to evaluate their performance on research-level
tasks at the frontier of mathematical knowledge. However, existing benchmarks
are limited, as they focus solely on final-answer questions or high-school
competition problems. To address this gap, we introduce IMProofBench, a private
benchmark consisting of 39 peer-reviewed problems developed by expert
mathematicians. Each problem requires a detailed proof and is paired with
subproblems that have final answers, supporting both an evaluation of
mathematical reasoning capabilities by human experts and a large-scale
quantitative analysis through automated grading. Furthermore, unlike prior
benchmarks, the evaluation setup simulates a realistic research environment:
models operate in an agentic framework with tools like web search for
literature review and mathematical software such as SageMath. Our results show
that current LLMs can succeed at the more accessible research-level questions,
but still encounter significant difficulties on more challenging problems.
Quantitatively, Grok-4 achieves the highest accuracy of 52% on final-answer
subproblems, while GPT-5 obtains the best performance for proof generation,
achieving a fully correct solution for 22% of problems. IMProofBench will
continue to evolve as a dynamic benchmark in collaboration with the
mathematical community, ensuring its relevance for evaluating the next
generation of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏明确的交互策略优化，依赖统一提示导致次优结果，需要更有效的策略学习框架。

Method: 分层框架：规划器选择策略（推荐、解释、鼓励等），执行器在专家网络指导下生成响应，使用强化学习和LLM奖励进行策略学习。

Result: 实验显示RSO优于现有最佳基线方法，验证了分层策略优化的有效性。

Conclusion: RSO框架通过策略解耦和强化学习有效提升了对话推荐系统的性能，为LLM在CRS中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) provide personalized
recommendations through multi-turn interactions. With the strong reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), applying them to CRSs has become
promising. Yet, existing methods often lack explicit optimization of
interaction strategies, relying instead on unified prompts, which can yield
suboptimal outcomes. We propose Reinforced Strategy Optimization (RSO), a
hierarchical framework that decomposes response generation into macro-level
strategy planning and micro-level adaptation within a network-of-experts. A
Planner selects strategies (e.g., recommend, explain, encourage), while an
Actor generates responses guided by auxiliary experts for preferences and
factual grounding. This disentanglement enables more tractable learning. To
address limited multi-turn data, we model strategy learning as reinforcement
learning with an LLM-based reward for exploration. Experiments show RSO
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of
hierarchical strategy optimization.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种算法，通过添加领域特定词汇来扩展预训练LLM的词表，解决词汇不匹配问题，提高处理速度而不降低分词效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当LLM处理训练领域之外的文本时，词汇不匹配问题会导致分词效率低下，增加处理延迟。通用领域的分词器无法有效处理领域特定术语，造成子词分割不理想。

Method: 设计一种算法来扩展现有分词器的词汇表，添加领域特定词汇，同时保证分词效率不会降低——每个输入序列的分词数量最多与之前相同。

Result: 在真实电商用例中，增强后的分词器将输入序列缩短达20%，降低下游任务推理延迟，同时保持预测质量。还分析了前向传播速度和模型采用新词汇的速率等次级效应。

Conclusion: 词汇适应具有更广泛的益处，能显著提升LLM在特定领域应用中的处理效率和性能。

Abstract: When using an LLM to process text outside the training domain(s), an often
overlooked factor is vocabulary mismatch, where the general-domain tokenizer
fails to capture frequent domain-specific terms, leading to higher token
fertility and thus a decrease in processing speed due to suboptimal sub-word
splits.
  We address this limitation by augmenting the pretrained vocabulary with a set
of domain-specific tokens. To this end, we design an algorithm that extends an
existing tokenizer while guaranteeing it never decreases tokenization
efficiency: every input sequence is segmented into at most the same number of
tokens as before.
  Evaluated on real-world e-Commerce use-cases, the augmented tokenizer
significantly shortens input sequences by up to 20% and reduces inference
latency on downstream tasks while preserving predictive quality. We further
analyze secondary effects, such as the impact on forward pass speed and the
rate at which the model adopts the newly introduced tokens, to illustrate the
broader benefits of vocabulary adaptation.

Method: 提出HATE（饥饿游戏辩论）实验框架，模拟零和竞争环境下的辩论，在不同LLM和任务上进行实验，并探索不同裁判反馈的影响。

Result: 竞争压力显著刺激了过度竞争行为并降低了任务性能，导致讨论偏离正轨；客观、任务导向的反馈有效缓解了过度竞争行为。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems demonstrate great potential for tackling
complex problems, but how competition shapes their behavior remains
underexplored. This paper investigates the over-competition in multi-agent
debate, where agents under extreme pressure exhibit unreliable, harmful
behaviors that undermine both collaboration and task performance. To study this
phenomenon, we propose HATE, the Hunger Game Debate, a novel experimental
framework that simulates debates under a zero-sum competition arena. Our
experiments, conducted across a range of LLMs and tasks, reveal that
competitive pressure significantly stimulates over-competition behaviors and
degrades task performance, causing discussions to derail. We further explore
the impact of environmental feedback by adding variants of judges, indicating
that objective, task-focused feedback effectively mitigates the
over-competition behaviors. We also probe the post-hoc kindness of LLMs and
form a leaderboard to characterize top LLMs, providing insights for
understanding and governing the emergent social dynamics of AI community.

the task of creating explanations of novel senses, taking target word usages as
an input. To this end, we employ the datasets from the AXOLOTL'24 shared task

German languages. We fine-tune and provide publicly the open-source models
performing higher than the best submissions of the aforementioned shared task,
which employed closed proprietary LLMs. In addition, we find that
encoder-decoder definition generators perform on par with their decoder-only
counterparts.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了VietBinoculars方法，通过优化全局阈值来改进越南语LLM生成文本的检测，在多个数据集上取得了超过99%的准确率、F1分数和AUC值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于transformer架构的大语言模型快速发展，区分人类书写文本和LLM生成文本变得日益困难，特别是越南语文本检测面临挑战，传统方法效果不佳。

Method: 构建新的越南语AI生成数据集，优化Binoculars方法的全局阈值，开发VietBinoculars检测模型。

Result: VietBinoculars在多个域外数据集上准确率、F1分数和AUC均超过99%，优于原始Binoculars模型、传统检测方法及其他先进方法，包括ZeroGPT和DetectGPT等商业工具。

Conclusion: VietBinoculars是检测越南语LLM生成文本的有效方法，特别在特定提示策略下表现优异，为多语言文本检测提供了有力工具。

Abstract: The rapid development research of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on
transformer architectures raises key challenges, one of them being the task of
distinguishing between human-written text and LLM-generated text. As
LLM-generated textual content, becomes increasingly complex over time, and
resembles human writing, traditional detection methods are proving less
effective, especially as the number and diversity of LLMs continue to grow with
new models and versions being released at a rapid pace. This study proposes
VietBinoculars, an adaptation of the Binoculars method with optimized global
thresholds, to enhance the detection of Vietnamese LLM-generated text. We have
constructed new Vietnamese AI-generated datasets to determine the optimal
thresholds for VietBinoculars and to enable benchmarking. The results from our
experiments show results show that VietBinoculars achieves over 99\% in all two
domains of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC on multiple out-of-domain datasets. It
outperforms the original Binoculars model, traditional detection methods, and
other state-of-the-art approaches, including commercial tools such as ZeroGPT
and DetectGPT, especially under specially modified prompting strategies.

TL;DR: 比较两种算法（蚁群优化和Google OR-Tools）在开放式容量车辆路径问题中的性能，评估路由效率、计算时间和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代物流管理系统需要高效的路径规划，开放式容量车辆路径问题涉及为服务地理分布客户的车辆寻找最优配送路线，且车辆在配送后无需返回仓库。

Method: 使用Python开发了两种算法的实现：基于自然启发的元启发式算法蚁群优化（ACO）和行业标准优化工具包Google OR-Tools，并使用自定义数据集进行测试。

Result: ACO在路由参数方面具有灵活性，而OR-Tools运行速度更快、一致性更高且需要更少的输入。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于为可扩展的实时物流系统选择合适的路由策略。

Abstract: In modern logistics management systems, route planning requires high
efficiency. The Open Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (OCVRP) deals with
finding optimal delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles serving geographically
distributed customers, without requiring the vehicles to return to the depot
after deliveries. The present study is comparative in nature and speaks of two
algorithms for OCVRP solution: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a nature-inspired
metaheuristic; and Google OR-Tools, an industry-standard toolkit for
optimization. Both implementations were developed in Python and using a custom
dataset. Performance appraisal was based on routing efficiency, computation
time, and scalability. The results show that ACO allows flexibility in routing
parameters while OR-Tools runs much faster with more consistency and requires
less input. This could help choose among routing strategies for scalable
real-time logistics systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TyleR是一种基于子图的归纳链接预测方法，利用预训练语言模型进行语义增强，在类型注释稀缺和图连接稀疏的场景下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实知识图谱中经常出现新实体，模型需要在不重新训练的情况下泛化到这些新实体。显式类型信息通常缺乏或不完整，即使可用也往往是粗粒度、稀疏且容易出错。

Method: 提出TyleR方法，利用预训练语言模型丰富节点表示中的隐式类型信号，实现无需显式类型但具有类型感知能力的子图链接预测。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，TyleR在类型注释稀缺和图连接稀疏的场景下优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型能够有效丰富节点表示中的隐式类型信号，为知识图谱的归纳链接预测提供了一种有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Inductive link prediction is emerging as a key paradigm for real-world
knowledge graphs (KGs), where new entities frequently appear and models must
generalize to them without retraining. Predicting links in a KG faces the
challenge of guessing previously unseen entities by leveraging generalizable
node features such as subgraph structure, type annotations, and ontological
constraints. However, explicit type information is often lacking or incomplete.
Even when available, type information in most KGs is often coarse-grained,
sparse, and prone to errors due to human annotation. In this work, we explore
the potential of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to enrich node
representations with implicit type signals. We introduce TyleR, a Type-less yet
type-awaRe approach for subgraph-based inductive link prediction that leverages
PLMs for semantic enrichment. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that TyleR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in scenarios with scarce type
annotations and sparse graph connectivity. To ensure reproducibility, we share
our code at https://github.com/sisinflab/tyler .

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA)方法，通过零学习率训练获取全局梯度，在领域训练中进行梯度增强和动态训练步长校正，结合退火学习建立仅依赖领域数据的微调流程，显著提升性能并大幅减少GPU时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法需要复杂的数据混合和重复实验才能获得最优泛化性能，这带来了训练效率低下的问题。

Method: 使用零学习率在通用数据上训练获取全局梯度，然后在领域训练中应用梯度增强和动态训练步长校正，结合退火学习建立微调流程。

Result: 在多个任务和基础模型上，DBA比传统微调方法在联合性能上平均提升5.8%，同时减少91.0%的GPU时间。

Conclusion: DBA提供了一种高效通用的解决方案，仅依赖领域数据即可实现性能提升，并显著降低了训练成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning shows excellent implications.
However, vanilla fine-tuning methods often require intricate data mixture and
repeated experiments for optimal generalization. To address these challenges
and streamline the training process, we propose an efficient and universal
solution, Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA). We obtain a global gradient through
zero-learning-rate training on general data, which is subsequently employed for
gradient boosting and dynamic training step correction during domain training.
In conjunction with annealing learning, we end up establishing a fine-tuning
pipeline that relies solely on domain data without collapse. By evaluating both
general and domain-specific performance across multiple tasks on several
popular base models, DBA achieves an average improvement of 5.8% in joint
performance over vanilla fine-tuning. Furthermore, since general data is no
longer involved in annealing, repeated experiments led by data mixture are also
eliminated. According to our tests, the DBA method can reduce GPU hours by
91.0% compared to the vanilla method.

*Morteza Rohanian,Michael Krauthammer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合语义初始化和规划损失的语音语言模型，通过自监督特征初始化、轻量对齐损失以及针对鲁棒性和内容规划的辅助目标来提升生成的一致性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过模型侧的设计和训练策略来控制语音生成中声学稳定性与语义基础之间的平衡，而不需要改变分词器或运行时架构。

Method: 使用自监督特征初始化语音token，应用轻量对齐损失，并采用稀疏化和辅助目标训练，构建了三个模型：0.7B纯语音模型、1.0B纯语音模型和1.0B文本语音交织模型。

Result: 纯语音模型在说话人、性别、情感、环境和背景因素上实现了最高的一致性，超越了更大的系统。交织模型提升了词汇句法探测和语义-声学对齐，但降低了一致性。线性探测显示初始化使模型偏向内容结构，但牺牲了韵律细节。

Conclusion: LM侧的设计和训练组合能够控制声学稳定性和语义基础之间的平衡，无需改变分词器或运行时架构。

Abstract: We study speech language models that incorporate semantic initialization and
planning losses to achieve robust and consistent generation. Our approach
initializes speech tokens with self-supervised features, applies a light
alignment loss, and trains with thinning and auxiliary objectives that target
robustness and content planning. We train three models: a 0.7B speech-only
model, a 1.0B speech-only model, and a 1.0B interleaved model with both text
and speech. Acoustic studies show that the speech-only models achieve the
highest consistency across speaker, gender, sentiment, room, and background
factors, surpassing larger systems. Interleaving improves lexical and syntactic
probes and semantic--acoustic alignment but reduces consistency. Linear probes
show that our initialization biases the model toward content structure while
trading off prosody detail. These results show that LM-side design and training
mix control the balance between acoustic stability and semantic grounding
without changes to the tokenizer or runtime architecture. A demo and model
weights are available for exploration.

Motivation: 传统对话摘要方法依赖人工标注，成本高且缺乏任务特定焦点，限制了在下游应用中的有效性

Method: 使用LLMs池零样本生成多个摘要和任务导向QA对，通过LLMs回答问题来评估摘要质量，选择最佳答案和最有信息量的摘要，然后微调最佳LLM

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，在零样本设置下取得竞争性结果，与全监督SotA方法相媲美

Conclusion: APP框架通过任务导向的效用评估实现了有效的对话摘要，无需昂贵的人工标注

Abstract: Dialogue summarization aims to distill the core meaning of a conversation
into a concise text. This is crucial for reducing the complexity and noise
inherent in dialogue-heavy applications. While recent approaches typically
train language models to mimic human-written summaries, such supervision is
costly and often results in outputs that lack task-specific focus limiting
their effectiveness in downstream applications, such as medical tasks. In this
paper, we propose \app, a framework for task-oriented utility-based dialogue
summarization. \app starts by generating multiple summaries and task-oriented
question-answer pairs from a dialogue in a zero-shot manner using a pool of
large language models (LLMs). The quality of the generated summaries is
evaluated by having LLMs answer task-related questions before \textit{(i)}
selecting the best candidate answers and \textit{(ii)} identifying the most
informative summary based on these answers. Finally, we fine-tune the best LLM
on the selected summaries. When validated on multiple datasets, \app
demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving competitive results in various
zero-shot settings, rivaling fully-supervised State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods.

TL;DR: 提出了Feedback Forensics开源工具包，用于追踪AI模型的人格变化，分析人类反馈数据集鼓励的人格特质，并评估流行模型展现这些特质的程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法难以明确衡量AI模型的人格特质，基于人类反馈的排名方法存在不透明性，且模型可能过度拟合这些反馈排行榜。缺乏公开工具来显式评估模型人格。

Method: 开发Feedback Forensics工具包，利用AI标注器通过Python API和浏览器应用调查人格特质，分析流行人类反馈数据集鼓励的人格特质，并评估模型展现这些特质的程度。

Result: 发布了Feedback Forensics工具包、追踪AI人格的Web应用以及底层标注数据，可用于分析Chatbot Arena、MultiPref和PRISM等数据集鼓励的人格特质。

Conclusion: Feedback Forensics工具包填补了现有评估方法的空白，能够显式追踪和分析AI模型的人格变化，有助于理解人类反馈如何塑造模型人格特质。

Abstract: Some traits making a "good" AI model are hard to describe upfront. For
example, should responses be more polite or more casual? Such traits are
sometimes summarized as model character or personality. Without a clear
objective, conventional benchmarks based on automatic validation struggle to
measure such traits. Evaluation methods using human feedback such as Chatbot
Arena have emerged as a popular alternative. These methods infer "better"
personality and other desirable traits implicitly by ranking multiple model
responses relative to each other. Recent issues with model releases highlight
limitations of these existing opaque evaluation approaches: a major model was
rolled back over sycophantic personality issues, models were observed
overfitting to such feedback-based leaderboards. Despite these known issues,
limited public tooling exists to explicitly evaluate model personality. We
introduce Feedback Forensics: an open-source toolkit to track AI personality
changes, both those encouraged by human (or AI) feedback, and those exhibited
across AI models trained and evaluated on such feedback. Leveraging AI
annotators, our toolkit enables investigating personality via Python API and
browser app. We demonstrate the toolkit's usefulness in two steps: (A) first we
analyse the personality traits encouraged in popular human feedback datasets
including Chatbot Arena, MultiPref and PRISM; and (B) then use our toolkit to
analyse how much popular models exhibit such traits. We release (1) our
Feedback Forensics toolkit alongside (2) a web app tracking AI personality in
popular models and feedback datasets as well as (3) the underlying annotation
data at https://github.com/rdnfn/feedback-forensics.

*Rui Ming,Haoyuan Wu,Shoubo Hu,Zhuolun He,Bei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为OTR的新微调算法，将监督微调与策略梯度方法结合，通过单步强化学习轨迹处理每个token生成，利用监督数据中的真实token提供奖励信号，从而提升语言模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)在泛化能力上通常不如强化学习(RL)，作者认为这种性能差异不仅源于损失函数，更根本的原因在于SFT使用固定的预收集数据集，而RL使用从当前策略采样的在线数据。

Method: OTR算法将自回归学习过程重新定义为单步强化学习轨迹，在每个步骤中从当前策略分布中采样多个候选token，使用监督数据中的真实token为这些样本提供奖励信号，通过策略梯度将静态的离线监督数据转化为动态的在线信号。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和通用领域推理等多个具有挑战性的基准测试中，OTR算法始终优于标准SFT方法。

Conclusion: OTR是一种强大且实用的LLM微调替代方案，证明了数据的在线性质是泛化能力的关键驱动因素，为微调LLMs提供了有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the predominant method for adapting large
language models (LLMs), yet it often struggles with generalization compared to
reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we posit that this performance
disparity stems not just from the loss function, but from a more fundamental
difference: SFT learns from a fixed, pre-collected dataset, whereas RL utilizes
on-policy data sampled from the current policy. Building on this hypothesis, we
introduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides
SFT with the policy gradient method. OTR reframes the autoregressive learning
process by treating each token generation as a single-step reinforcement
learning trajectory. At each step, it performs a Monte Carlo ``rollout'' by
sampling multiple candidate tokens from the current policy's distribution. The
ground-truth token from the supervised data is then used to provide a reward
signal to these samples. Guided by policy gradient, our algorithm repurposes
static, off-policy supervised data into a dynamic, on-policy signal at the
token level, capturing the generalization benefits of on-policy learning while
bypassing the costly overhead of full sentence generation. Through extensive
experiments on a diverse suite of challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical
reasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning, we demonstrate that
OTR consistently outperforms standard SFT. Our findings establish OTR as a
powerful and practical alternative for fine-tuning LLMs and provide compelling
evidence that the on-policy nature of data is a critical driver of
generalization, offering a promising new direction for fine-tuning LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了Huggin-3.5B的潜在思维过程，发现正确与错误答案的潜在思维模式具有明显区别，提出基于潜在分类器的潜在思维优化方法，能有效改进LLM的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM的链式思维推理计算成本高且容易过度思考，而潜在思维架构缺乏可解释性和监督机制，需要研究如何改进潜在思维过程的正确性和可靠性。

Method: 提出潜在思维优化(LTO)算法，使用潜在分类器作为潜在奖励模型(LRM)来优化潜在思维过程，通过检测错误思维模式来改进推理质量。

Result: 实验表明LRM能有效检测错误潜在思维模式，LTO能显著改进潜在思维过程，且该方法能泛化到不同领域并应用于通用LLM。

Conclusion: 与语言思维相比，在潜在空间进行奖励建模和监督扩展思维是一种通用、高效且领域无关的改进LLM思维过程的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at problem solving by generating chain of
thoughts in natural language, but such verbal thinking is computationally
costly and prone to overthinking. Recent work instead proposes a latent
thinking architecture Huggin-3.5B, which represents intermediate reasoning
steps as sequence of latent representations. However, latent thoughts lack
interpretability and are difficult to supervise, raising concerns about the
correctness and reliability of its latent thinking processes. In this paper, we
provide a systematic study of how Huggin-3.5B thinks in the latent space and
how external supervision signals can improve its latent thinking processes. We
show that latent thoughts leading to correct versus incorrect answers exhibit
highly distinguishable patterns, and that a latent classifier can reliably
predict answer correctness directly from latent thoughts. Leveraging these
insights, we propose Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO), a probabilistic
algorithm that employs the latent classifier as a Latent Reward Model (LRM) to
optimize the latent thinking processes. Extensive experiments across diverse
reasoning tasks demonstrate that LRM is highly effective in detecting incorrect
latent thinking patterns, and LTO can significantly improve the latent thinking
processes. Furthermore, we show that LRM can generalize across diverse domains,
and LTO can be seamlessly applied to general LLMs to improve their thinking
processes. In contrast to verbal thinking, our method demonstrates that reward
modeling and scaling test-time thinking with supervision can be performed
directly in the latent space, highlighting its potential as a general,
efficient, and domain-agnostic approach to improving the thinking processes of
LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fast-dLLM v2 是一种基于块扩散的语言模型，能够将预训练的自回归模型高效转换为并行文本生成模型，仅需约10亿token的微调，训练数据减少500倍，同时保持原始模型性能，推理速度提升2.5倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归大语言模型在自然语言任务中表现出色，但其固有的顺序解码限制了推理效率，需要开发更高效的并行生成方法。

Method: 提出块扩散机制与互补注意力掩码相结合的训练方法，支持块级双向上下文建模；设计分层缓存机制（块级缓存和子块缓存）加速解码；构建并行解码流水线。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，Fast-dLLM v2 在准确性上匹配或超越自回归基线，同时在dLLM中实现最先进的效率，推理速度提升达2.5倍。

Conclusion: Fast-dLLM v2 标志着向快速准确LLM实际部署迈出了重要一步，在保持性能的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across a wide range of natural language tasks, yet their inherent
sequential decoding limits inference efficiency. In this work, we propose
Fast-dLLM v2, a carefully designed block diffusion language model (dLLM) that
efficiently adapts pretrained AR models into dLLMs for parallel text
generation, requiring only approximately 1B tokens of fine-tuning. This
represents a 500x reduction in training data compared to full-attention
diffusion LLMs such as Dream (580B tokens), while preserving the original
model's performance. Our approach introduces a novel training recipe that
combines a block diffusion mechanism with a complementary attention mask,
enabling blockwise bidirectional context modeling without sacrificing AR
training objectives. To further accelerate decoding, we design a hierarchical
caching mechanism: a block-level cache that stores historical context
representations across blocks, and a sub-block cache that enables efficient
parallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel
decoding pipeline, Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard AR
decoding without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-dLLM v2 matches or surpasses AR
baselines in accuracy, while delivering state-of-the-art efficiency among dLLMs
- marking a significant step toward the practical deployment of fast and
accurate LLMs. Code and model will be publicly released.

TL;DR: KG-R1是一个通过强化学习实现的单代理知识图谱检索增强生成框架，相比传统多模块KG-RAG系统更高效且具有可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KG-RAG系统使用多个LLM模块（如规划、推理、响应），导致推理成本高且行为绑定到特定知识图谱。需要解决效率和可迁移性问题。

Method: 使用单一代理与知识图谱环境交互，学习逐步检索并将检索信息整合到推理和生成中，通过端到端强化学习进行优化。

Result: 在KGQA基准测试中，使用Qwen-2.5-3B模型，KG-R1以更少的生成token提高了答案准确性，优于使用更大模型的多模块方法，且在新知识图谱上无需修改即可保持强准确性。

Conclusion: KG-R1是一个有前景的KG-RAG框架，具有高效性和可迁移性，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large
language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to
reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems
compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding),
inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To
address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation
(KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single
agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each
step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and
generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled
experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our
method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B,
KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior
multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models.
Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong
accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a
promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.

Motivation: 真实性评估语言话语与现实世界信息的关联程度，对于事实核查至关重要，但这是一个依赖多种语言信号的复杂概念。

Method: 开发了一个多方面的真实性标注方案，手动标注了近5000个议会话语领域的句子，并测试了自动预测方案特征的各种方法。

Result: 报告了标注者间一致性，并实验了将标注扩展到大型语料库的自动化方法。

Conclusion: 该标注方案虽然为希伯来语开发，但相信可以适应其他语言，为真实性分析提供了系统化的框架。

Abstract: Factuality assesses the extent to which a language utterance relates to
real-world information; it determines whether utterances correspond to facts,
possibilities, or imaginary situations, and as such, it is instrumental for
fact checking. Factuality is a complex notion that relies on multiple
linguistic signals, and has been studied in various disciplines.
  We present a complex, multi-faceted annotation scheme of factuality that
combines concepts from a variety of previous works. We developed the scheme for
Hebrew, but we trust that it can be adapted to other languages. We also present
a set of almost 5,000 sentences in the domain of parliamentary discourse that
we manually annotated according to this scheme. We report on inter-annotator
agreement, and experiment with various approaches to automatically predict
(some features of) the scheme, in order to extend the annotation to a large
corpus.

Abstract: False information poses a significant global challenge, and manually
verifying claims is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. In this
research paper, we experiment with different approaches to investigate the
effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in classifying factual claims by
their veracity and generating justifications in English and Telugu. The key
contributions of this work include the creation of a bilingual English-Telugu
dataset and the benchmarking of different veracity classification approaches
based on LLMs.

*Yanbin Fu,Hong Jiao,Tianyi Zhou,Robert W. Lissitz,Nan Zhang,Ming Li,Qingshu Xu,Sydney Peters*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了使用微调的小型语言模型(SLMs)自动进行试题与内容标准对齐的性能，发现在包含更多试题文本数据时模型表现显著提升，且微调SLMs在细粒度技能对齐方面优于基于嵌入的监督机器学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的试题对齐通常由人类专家进行，这个过程主观且耗时，需要开发自动化的解决方案来提高效率和客观性。

Method: 使用来自大学入学标准化阅读写作测试的数据，为不同内容领域和技能级别分别训练了多个小型语言模型，并研究了输入数据类型和大小对训练的影响。

Result: 包含更多试题文本数据显著提升了模型性能，微调SLMs在技能对齐任务中持续优于基于嵌入的监督机器学习模型。语义相似性分析显示某些技能在语义上过于接近，这解释了观察到的错误分类。

Conclusion: 微调的小型语言模型在自动化试题对齐方面表现出色，特别是在细粒度技能对齐任务中，为测试开发提供了有效的自动化工具。

Abstract: Aligning test items to content standards is a critical step in test
development to collect validity evidence based on content. Item alignment has
typically been conducted by human experts. This judgmental process can be
subjective and time-consuming. This study investigated the performance of
fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) for automated item alignment using data
from a large-scale standardized reading and writing test for college
admissions. Different SLMs were trained for alignment at both domain and skill
levels respectively with 10 skills mapped to 4 content domains. The model
performance was evaluated in multiple criteria on two testing datasets. The
impact of types and sizes of the input data for training was investigated.
Results showed that including more item text data led to substantially better
model performance, surpassing the improvements induced by sample size increase
alone. For comparison, supervised machine learning models were trained using
the embeddings from the multilingual-E5-large-instruct model. The study results
showed that fine-tuned SLMs consistently outperformed the embedding-based
supervised machine learning models, particularly for the more fine-grained
skill alignment. To better understand model misclassifications, multiple
semantic similarity analysis including pairwise cosine similarity,
Kullback-Leibler divergence of embedding distributions, and two-dimension
projections of item embeddings were conducted. These analyses consistently
showed that certain skills in SAT and PSAT were semantically too close,
providing evidence for the observed misclassification.

*Sangwon Ryu,Heejin Do,Yunsu Kim,Gary Geunbae Lee,Jungseul Ok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出PACO框架，通过自适应规划解决多属性可控摘要中的属性依赖问题，无需训练即可实现多属性约束的满足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控摘要方法面临属性间相互依赖的挑战，难以一致满足相关约束，且通常需要针对每个属性进行微调，限制了灵活性。

Method: 使用训练免费的框架，将任务重新定义为规划顺序属性控制，采用定制化的蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS），通过单属性调整逐步优化需要进一步控制的属性。

Result: 在多个领域和模型上的实验表明，PACO实现了强大的多属性可控性，超越了基于LLM的自规划模型和微调基线。

Conclusion: PACO框架能够有效解决多属性可控摘要中的挑战，在不同规模模型上都表现出色，特别是在大模型上实现了最优的控制性能。

Abstract: Controllable summarization moves beyond generic outputs toward human-aligned
summaries guided by specified attributes. In practice, the interdependence
among attributes makes it challenging for language models to satisfy correlated
constraints consistently. Moreover, previous approaches often require
per-attribute fine-tuning, limiting flexibility across diverse summary
attributes. In this paper, we propose adaptive planning for multi-attribute
controllable summarization (PACO), a training-free framework that reframes the
task as planning the order of sequential attribute control with a customized
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In PACO, nodes represent summaries, and actions
correspond to single-attribute adjustments, enabling progressive refinement of
only the attributes requiring further control. This strategy adaptively
discovers optimal control orders, ultimately producing summaries that
effectively meet all constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
and models demonstrate that PACO achieves robust multi-attribute
controllability, surpassing both LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned
baselines. Remarkably, PACO with Llama-3.2-1B rivals the controllability of the
much larger Llama-3.3-70B baselines. With larger models, PACO achieves superior
control performance, outperforming all competitors.

TL;DR: CreAgentive是一个基于智能体工作流的创意生成引擎，通过故事原型和三级工作流解决大语言模型在创意写作中的四个关键限制：体裁多样性不足、输出长度不够、叙事连贯性差、无法执行复杂结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当代大语言模型在创意写作中的四个主要限制：体裁多样性受限、输出长度不足、叙事连贯性弱、无法强制执行复杂结构构造。

Method: 采用基于知识图谱的故事原型作为体裁无关的叙事表示，通过三级智能体工作流：初始化阶段构建用户指定的叙事骨架，生成阶段通过长短目标指导多智能体对话实例化故事原型，写作阶段利用原型生成具有回溯和预示等高级结构的多体裁文本。

Result: 在广泛实验中，CreAgentive以稳定质量和低成本（每100章节少于1美元）生成了数千章节，在包含10个叙事指标的双维度评估框架中持续优于强基线，在不同体裁中表现稳健，接近人类创作小说的质量。

Conclusion: CreAgentive通过故事原型和智能体工作流架构有效解决了长文本生成的典型瓶颈，减少了存储冗余，实现了高质量、低成本的多体裁创意生成。

Abstract: We present CreAgentive, an agent workflow driven multi-category creative
generation engine that addresses four key limitations of contemporary large
language models in writing stories, drama and other categories of creatives:
restricted genre diversity, insufficient output length, weak narrative
coherence, and inability to enforce complex structural constructs. At its core,
CreAgentive employs a Story Prototype, which is a genre-agnostic, knowledge
graph-based narrative representation that decouples story logic from stylistic
realization by encoding characters, events, and environments as semantic
triples. CreAgentive engages a three-stage agent workflow that comprises: an
Initialization Stage that constructs a user-specified narrative skeleton; a
Generation Stage in which long- and short-term objectives guide multi-agent
dialogues to instantiate the Story Prototype; a Writing Stage that leverages
this prototype to produce multi-genre text with advanced structures such as
retrospection and foreshadowing. This architecture reduces storage redundancy
and overcomes the typical bottlenecks of long-form generation. In extensive
experiments, CreAgentive generates thousands of chapters with stable quality
and low cost (less than $1 per 100 chapters) using a general-purpose backbone
model. To evaluate performance, we define a two-dimensional framework with 10
narrative indicators measuring both quality and length. Results show that
CreAgentive consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves robust
performance across diverse genres, approaching the quality of human-authored
novels.

TL;DR: 提出一个统一的回归语言模型(RLM)，能够直接从代码文本预测多种执行指标，包括内存占用、GPU内核延迟和神经网络性能，无需复杂的特征工程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决代码到指标回归的挑战性任务，传统方法需要大量特定领域的特征工程，而RLM提供统一的解决方案。

Method: 使用300M参数的回归语言模型，基于T5Gemma初始化，直接从代码文本预测多种执行指标。

Result: 在APPS竞赛提交上获得>0.9的Spearman秩相关系数，在CodeNet的17种语言上平均>0.5，在NAS设计空间上获得0.46的Kendall-Tau系数。

Conclusion: RLM展示了统一模型在多种代码相关回归任务上的有效性，超越了传统图神经网络方法。

Abstract: We study code-to-metric regression: predicting numeric outcomes of code
executions, a challenging task due to the open-ended nature of programming
languages. While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific
feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model
(RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint
of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the
latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained
neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M
parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on
competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model
achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet.
Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five
classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and
simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: dParallel是一种简单有效的方法，通过确定性强制蒸馏训练策略，解锁扩散大语言模型的并行解码潜力，大幅减少解码步骤同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型作为自回归生成的有前景替代方案，具有并行令牌预测和更低推理延迟的优势，但其并行解码潜力尚未充分探索，现有开源模型仍需接近令牌长度的解码步骤来保证性能。

Method: 提出dParallel方法，核心是确定性强制蒸馏训练策略，通过蒸馏模型遵循原始采样轨迹，同时强制模型在掩码令牌上更快地并行达到高确定性。

Result: 在LLaDA-8B-Instruct模型上，dParallel将GSM8K的解码步骤从256减少到30，实现8.5倍加速且无性能下降；在MBPP基准测试中，将解码步骤从256减少到24，实现10.5倍加速同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: dParallel方法能够显著减少扩散大语言模型的解码步骤，同时维持性能，为并行解码提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently drawn considerable
attention within the research community as a promising alternative to
autoregressive generation, offering parallel token prediction and lower
inference latency. Yet, their parallel decoding potential remains largely
underexplored, as existing open-source models still require nearly token-length
decoding steps to ensure performance. To address this, we introduce dParallel,
a simple and effective method that unlocks the inherent parallelism of dLLMs
for fast sampling. We identify that the key bottleneck to parallel decoding
arises from the sequential certainty convergence for masked tokens. Building on
this insight, we introduce the core of our approach: certainty-forcing
distillation, a novel training strategy that distills the model to follow its
original sampling trajectories while enforcing it to achieve high certainty on
masked tokens more rapidly and in parallel. Extensive experiments across
various benchmarks demonstrate that our method can dramatically reduce the
number of decoding steps while maintaining performance. When applied to the
LLaDA-8B-Instruct model, dParallel reduces decoding steps from 256 to 30 on
GSM8K, achieving an 8.5x speedup without performance degradation. On the MBPP
benchmark, it cuts decoding steps from 256 to 24, resulting in a 10.5x speedup
while maintaining accuracy. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法充分评估智能体处理大量信息、利用多样化资源和管理动态用户交互的复杂性，需要更贴近真实应用场景的评估标准。

Method: 基于日常生活应用构建模拟环境，通过消除领域特定策略实现场景和工具的灵活组合，提出基于评分的滑动窗口评估器来评估多样化解决方案路径。

Result: 即使在最先进的模型上，跨场景任务的成功率仅为30%，其他任务的成功率也不到50%，表明当前智能体在复杂现实场景中仍有很大提升空间。

Conclusion: VitaBench将为推进AI智能体在实际应用中的发展提供宝贵资源，揭示了当前模型在复杂现实任务中的局限性。

Abstract: As LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-life scenarios,
existing benchmarks fail to capture their inherent complexity of handling
extensive information, leveraging diverse resources, and managing dynamic user
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging
benchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in
real-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store
consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the
most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools.
Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable
flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario
tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from
multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and
spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous
instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn
conversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator,
enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments
and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the
most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and
less than 50% success rate on others. Overall, we believe VitaBench will serve
as a valuable resource for advancing the development of AI agents in practical
real-world applications. The code, dataset, and leaderboard are available at

TL;DR: BatonVoice是一个新的可控文本转语音框架，通过将LLM作为"指挥家"理解用户指令并生成文本化的声音特征，再由专门的TTS模型"乐团"生成语音，实现了更好的指令跟随能力和跨语言泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用LLM的语言智能和指令跟随能力，限制了可控TTS的发展。

Method: 采用"操作主义"范式，将指令理解与语音生成解耦：LLM作为指挥家生成文本化声音特征计划，BatonTTS作为乐团执行语音合成。

Result: 在可控和情感语音合成方面表现优异，超越了开源和闭源基线，并实现了出色的零样本跨语言泛化能力。

Conclusion: 将语音对象化为文本声音特征能更有效地释放LLM的语言智能潜力。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping multimodel models, with
speech synthesis being a prominent application. However, existing approaches
often underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically
failing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This
limitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for
controllable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm
inspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from
speech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a
``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual
``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS
model, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To
realize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically
for this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong
performance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming
strong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables
remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature
control abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates
that objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively
unlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出Matryoshka MoE训练框架，通过训练时系统性地改变激活专家数量，使MoE模型具备弹性推理能力，在不同专家数量下都能保持良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Top-K路由器的训练策略限制了MoE模型在弹性推理中的潜力，当推理时改变激活专家数量时会导致性能急剧下降。

Method: 在训练过程中系统性地改变激活专家数量，强制模型学习有意义的专家排序：排名靠前的专家提供基础能力，后续专家添加更精细的细节。采用分层随机化策略。

Result: 单个M-MoE模型在不同专家数量下都能达到接近专用模型套件的性能，但训练成本显著降低。

Conclusion: M-MoE框架为大规模MoE模型的实际部署提供了更实用和灵活的解决方案，实现了弹性推理和计算资源优化分配。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for efficiently
scaling large language models without a proportional increase in computational
cost. However, the standard training strategy of Top-K router prevents MoE
models from realizing their full potential for elastic inference. When the
number of activated experts is altered at inference time, these models exhibit
precipitous performance degradation. In this work, we introduce Matryoshka MoE
(M-MoE), a training framework that instills a coarse-to-fine structure directly
into the expert ensemble. By systematically varying the number of activated
experts during training, M-MoE compels the model to learn a meaningful ranking:
top-ranked experts collaborate to provide essential, coarse-grained
capabilities, while subsequent experts add progressively finer-grained detail.
We explore this principle at multiple granularities, identifying a layer-wise
randomization strategy as the most effective. Our experiments demonstrate that
a single M-MoE model achieves remarkable elasticity, with its performance at
various expert counts closely matching that of an entire suite of specialist
models, but at only a fraction of the total training cost. This flexibility not
only unlocks elastic inference but also enables optimizing performance by
allocating different computational budgets to different model layers. Our work
paves the way for more practical and adaptable deployments of large-scale MoE
models.

Conclusion: OceanGym为开发鲁棒具身AI提供了高保真测试平台，是向真实世界自主水下航行器能力转移的关键一步，标志着在地球最后未开发前沿领域实现智能操作的重要进展。

Abstract: We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater
embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world
environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present
extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility,
dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally
difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified
agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which
integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are
required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex
environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh
conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between
state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the
persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean
underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed
platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and
transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater
vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of
operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are

Motivation: 对比性解释（说明为什么AI系统产生某个输出而非另一个）在可解释AI中被认为比标准解释更具信息性和可解释性，但目前为语音转文本生成模型获取此类解释仍是一个开放挑战。

Method: 基于特征归因技术，通过分析输入频谱图的各个部分如何影响在替代输出之间的选择来获得对比性解释。

Result: 在语音翻译性别分配的案例研究中，该方法能准确识别驱动选择某一性别而非另一性别的音频特征。

Conclusion: 通过将对比性解释的范围扩展到语音转文本领域，为更好地理解语音转文本模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Contrastive explanations, which indicate why an AI system produced one output
(the target) instead of another (the foil), are widely regarded in explainable
AI as more informative and interpretable than standard explanations. However,
obtaining such explanations for speech-to-text (S2T) generative models remains
an open challenge. Drawing from feature attribution techniques, we propose the
first method to obtain contrastive explanations in S2T by analyzing how parts
of the input spectrogram influence the choice between alternative outputs.
Through a case study on gender assignment in speech translation, we show that
our method accurately identifies the audio features that drive the selection of
one gender over another. By extending the scope of contrastive explanations to
S2T, our work provides a foundation for better understanding S2T models.

TL;DR: FuncBenchGen是一个用于评估工具增强语言模型的合成基准框架，通过生成多步骤工具使用任务来避免数据污染问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强语言模型基准存在数据污染风险，且无法精确控制任务复杂度、函数数量等因素，需要更可控的评估方法。

Method: 将工具使用建模为在隐藏函数依赖DAG上的遍历，给定函数模式、初始变量和目标变量，模型需要组合正确的调用序列来计算目标变量。

Result: 推理优化模型表现优于通用模型，GPT-5表现最佳；性能随依赖深度增加而显著下降；连接的不相关函数特别难以处理；模型经常传播错误参数值。

Conclusion: LLMs在多轮工具使用中存在脆弱的状态跟踪问题，通过显式重述先前变量值的简单缓解策略可以显著提升性能。

Abstract: As language models gain access to external tools via structured function
calls, they become increasingly more capable of solving complex, multi-step
tasks. However, existing benchmarks for tool-augmented language models (TaLMs)
provide insufficient control over factors such as the number of functions
accessible, task complexity, and input size, and remain vulnerable to data
contamination. We present FuncBenchGen, a unified, contamination-free framework
that evaluates TaLMs by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks. The key
idea is to cast tool use as traversal over a hidden function-dependency DAG
where nodes are function calls and an edge between nodes represents one
function consuming the output of another. Given a set of external function
schemas, initial variable values, and a target variable, models must compose
the correct call sequence to compute the target variable. FuncBenchGen allows
users to precisely control task difficulty (e.g., graph size, dependency depth,
and distractor functions) while avoiding data leakage. We apply our
FuncBenchGen framework to evaluate seven LLMs on tool use tasks of varying
difficulty. Reasoning-optimized models consistently outperform general-purpose
models with GPT-5 significantly outperforming other models. Performance
declines sharply as dependency depth increases. Furthermore, connected
irrelevant functions prove especially difficult to handle. We find that strong
models often make syntactically valid function calls but propagate incorrect or
stale argument values across steps, revealing brittle state tracking by LLMs in
multi-turn tool use. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a simple
mitigation strategy that explicitly restates prior variable values to the agent
at each step. Surprisingly, this lightweight change yields substantial gains
across models. e.g., yielding a success rate improvement from 62.5% to 81.3%
for GPT-5.

Motivation: 现实世界的机器翻译基准很快过时，因为大多数例子对最先进的翻译模型来说太容易，限制了基准区分模型优劣和揭示弱点的能力

Method: 让大语言模型迭代查询目标机器翻译模型，引导其生成困难示例，通过迭代优化源文本来增加翻译难度

Result: 生成的示例对目标MT模型更具挑战性，同时保持自然文本的多样性，难度还能迁移到其他模型和语言

Conclusion: MT-breaker方法能有效生成具有挑战性的机器翻译测试用例，解决了现有方法在识别困难示例和保持多样性方面的不足

Abstract: Machine translation benchmarks sourced from the real world are quickly
obsoleted, due to most examples being easy for state-of-the-art translation
models. This limits the benchmark's ability to distinguish which model is
better or to reveal models' weaknesses. Current methods for creating difficult
test cases, such as subsampling or from-scratch synthesis, either fall short of
identifying difficult examples or suffer from a lack of diversity and
naturalness. Inspired by the iterative process of human experts probing for
model failures, we propose MT-breaker, a method where a large language model
iteratively refines a source text to increase its translation difficulty. The
LLM iteratively queries a target machine translation model to guide its
generation of difficult examples. Our approach generates examples that are more
challenging for the target MT model while preserving the diversity of natural
texts. While the examples are tailored to a particular machine translation
model during the generation, the difficulty also transfers to other models and
languages.

TL;DR: LLM生成的基准测试存在自我偏见，会系统性偏向生成该基准的模型，特别是在低资源语言的翻译任务中。这种偏见来自生成的测试数据和评估方法两方面，且受到模型在源语言生成能力的影响。

Motivation: 随着大语言模型开始饱和现有基准测试，使用LLM自动创建基准测试成为可扩展的替代方案。但需要验证这些生成测试集是否存在系统性偏见。

Method: 研究LLM作为基准测试在翻译任务中的自我偏见问题，分析偏见来源（测试数据生成和评估方法），并探讨模型生成能力和源文本多样性对偏见的影响。

Result: 发现LLM生成的基准测试确实存在系统性自我偏见，特别是在英译任务中偏见更明显。偏见主要来自测试数据生成和评估方法两方面，且源文本多样性低是导致偏见的重要因素。

Conclusion: LLM作为基准测试存在严重的自我偏见问题，改进生成源文本的多样性可以部分缓解这种偏见，但需要谨慎使用自动生成的基准测试来评估模型性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) begin to saturate existing benchmarks,
automated benchmark creation using LLMs (LLM as a benchmark) has emerged as a
scalable alternative to slow and costly human curation. While these generated
test sets have to potential to cheaply rank models, we demonstrate a critical
flaw. LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the
benchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English
translation tasks. We show three key findings on automatic benchmarking of LLMs
for translation: First, this bias originates from two sources: the generated
test data (LLM as a testset) and the evaluation method (LLM as an evaluator),
with their combination amplifying the effect. Second, self bias in LLM as a
benchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the
source language. For instance, we observe more pronounced bias in into English
translation, where the model's generation system is developed, than in out of
English translation tasks. Third, we observe that low diversity in source text
is one attribution to self bias. Our results suggest that improving the
diversity of these generated source texts can mitigate some of the observed
self bias.

TL;DR: MENLO框架通过受众设计机制评估LLM的多语言响应质量，创建了包含6423个人工标注偏好对的数据集，在47种语言变体中评估四个质量维度。研究发现零样本LLM评估器能从成对评估和结构化标注标准中获益，但仍不如人工标注者。通过强化学习微调等方法可显著改进评估器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保大型语言模型在多语言环境下的响应质量达到母语水平具有挑战性，需要开发有效的评估框架来提升多语言能力。

Method: 引入MENLO评估框架，基于受众设计机制创建人工标注数据集，采用成对偏好评估、结构化标注标准，并通过强化学习微调、奖励塑造和多任务学习来改进LLM评估器。

Result: 零样本LLM评估器在成对评估和结构化标准下表现改善，但仍落后于人工标注者。强化学习训练的评估器可作为生成奖励模型提升LLM多语言能力，但与人类判断仍存在差异。

Conclusion: MENLO为可扩展的多语言评估和偏好对齐提供了有前景的方向，发布了数据集和评估框架以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Ensuring native-like quality of large language model (LLM) responses across
many languages is challenging. To address this, we introduce MENLO, a framework
that operationalizes the evaluation of native-like response quality based on
audience design-inspired mechanisms. Using MENLO, we create a dataset of 6,423
human-annotated prompt-response preference pairs covering four quality
dimensions with high inter-annotator agreement in 47 language varieties. Our
evaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from
pairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still
underperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial
improvements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping,
and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, we show that RL-trained
judges can serve as generative reward models to enhance LLMs' multilingual
proficiency, though discrepancies with human judgment remain. Our findings
suggest promising directions for scalable multilingual evaluation and
preference alignment. We release our dataset and evaluation framework to
support further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.

TL;DR: DeepScientist是一个目标导向的自主科学发现系统，通过贝叶斯优化和分层评估流程，在三个前沿AI任务上超越了人类设计的最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有AI科学家系统缺乏聚焦性、无法针对紧迫人类挑战产生有价值科学贡献的问题。

Method: 将科学发现形式化为贝叶斯优化问题，采用"假设-验证-分析"的分层评估流程，利用累积发现记忆智能平衡探索与利用。

Result: 消耗超过20,000 GPU小时，生成约5,000个独特科学想法，实验验证约1,100个，在三个前沿AI任务上分别超越人类SOTA方法183.7%、1.9%和7.9%。

Conclusion: 这是首个大规模证据表明AI能够在科学任务上实现逐步超越人类最先进水平的发现，真正推动科学发现的前沿。

Abstract: While previous AI Scientist systems can generate novel findings, they often
lack the focus to produce scientifically valuable contributions that address
pressing human-defined challenges. We introduce DeepScientist, a system
designed to overcome this by conducting goal-oriented, fully autonomous
scientific discovery over month-long timelines. It formalizes discovery as a
Bayesian Optimization problem, operationalized through a hierarchical
evaluation process consisting of "hypothesize, verify, and analyze". Leveraging
a cumulative Findings Memory, this loop intelligently balances the exploration
of novel hypotheses with exploitation, selectively promoting the most promising
findings to higher-fidelity levels of validation. Consuming over 20,000 GPU
hours, the system generated about 5,000 unique scientific ideas and
experimentally validated approximately 1100 of them, ultimately surpassing
human-designed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three frontier AI tasks by
183.7\%, 1.9\%, and 7.9\%. This work provides the first large-scale evidence of
an AI achieving discoveries that progressively surpass human SOTA on scientific
tasks, producing valuable findings that genuinely push the frontier of
scientific discovery. To facilitate further research into this process, we will
open-source all experimental logs and system code at

TL;DR: 该论文提出将寻找NLP模型中最具挑战性测试数据的问题形式化为多臂老虎机问题，通过高效识别最困难的主题来优化计算资源使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP模型需要具有足够挑战性的测试数据，但直接从互联网上数以万计的主题中寻找最困难的主题在计算上是不可行的。

Method: 将每个主题视为老虎机的'臂'，通过拉臂（抽样单个示例）来评估难度，使用多臂老虎机策略在固定计算预算内高效识别最困难主题。

Result: 在机器翻译任务中，各种老虎机策略显著优于暴力搜索等基线方法。

Conclusion: 多臂老虎机框架能够有效解决在大量主题中寻找最具挑战性测试数据的问题，大幅提升计算效率。

Abstract: NLP models require test data that are sufficiently challenging. The
difficulty of an example is linked to the topic it originates from (''seed
topic''). The relationship between the topic and the difficulty of its
instances is stochastic in nature: an example about a difficult topic can
happen to be easy, and vice versa. At the scale of the Internet, there are tens
of thousands of potential topics, and finding the most difficult one by drawing
and evaluating a large number of examples across all topics is computationally
infeasible. We formalize this task and treat it as a multi-armed bandit
problem. In this framework, each topic is an ''arm,'' and pulling an arm (at a
cost) involves drawing a single example, evaluating it, and measuring its
difficulty. The goal is to efficiently identify the most difficult topics
within a fixed computational budget. We illustrate the bandit problem setup of
finding difficult examples for the task of machine translation. We find that
various bandit strategies vastly outperform baseline methods like brute-force
searching the most challenging topics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了音节级语音标记化在口语语言建模中的应用，发现相比传统高帧率标记，音节标记能显著降低训练和推理成本，同时保持或提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统口语语言模型使用高帧率语音标记，但Transformer的自注意力机制在处理长序列时计算成本高昂。音节级标记化能显著压缩标记长度(4-5Hz)，但尚未在口语语言建模中得到充分探索。

Method: 对音节标记化进行系统研究，在多个口语理解基准上评估模型，同时改变训练数据规模，比较音节标记与传统高帧率标记的性能和效率。

Result: 音节标记在匹配或超越传统高帧率标记性能的同时，显著降低训练和推理成本：训练时间减少2倍以上，FLOPs减少5倍。

Conclusion: 音节级语言建模是实现高效长上下文口语语言模型的有前景路径。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) typically discretize speech into
high-frame-rate tokens extracted from SSL speech models. As the most successful
LMs are based on the Transformer architecture, processing these long token
streams with self-attention is expensive, as attention scales quadratically
with sequence length. A recent SSL work introduces acoustic tokenization of
speech at the syllable level, which is more interpretable and potentially more
scalable with significant compression in token lengths (4-5 Hz). Yet, their
value for spoken language modeling is not yet fully explored. We present the
first systematic study of syllabic tokenization for spoken language modeling,
evaluating models on a suite of SLU benchmarks while varying training data
scale. Syllabic tokens can match or surpass the previous high-frame rate tokens
while significantly cutting training and inference costs, achieving more than a
2x reduction in training time and a 5x reduction in FLOPs. Our findings
highlight syllable-level language modeling as a promising path to efficient
long-context spoken language models.

*Finlay Fehlauer,Kyle Mahowald,Tiago Pimentel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了不同随机种子训练的语言模型的收敛性，发现了一个四阶段收敛模式，并揭示了模型大小和词汇类别对收敛稳定性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在不同随机种子训练下的收敛特性，了解模型训练过程中分布学习的稳定性。

Method: 通过计算不同随机种子下语言模型的每token KL散度来测量收敛性，分析模型大小、训练检查点以及不同词汇类别（词频和词性）对收敛的影响。

Result: 发现了四阶段收敛模式：初始均匀阶段、快速收敛阶段、快速发散阶段和缓慢再收敛阶段；大模型在后期训练阶段再收敛更快，小模型无法完全再收敛；高频词和功能词比低频词和实词收敛更快更稳定。

Conclusion: 模型大小是学习稳定分布的必要条件，收敛在不同语言类别间不均匀，这些发现揭示了影响模型训练中分布学习稳定性的关键因素。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence of language models (LMs)
trained under different random seeds, measuring convergence as the expected
per-token Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence across seeds. By comparing LM
convergence as a function of model size and training checkpoint, we identify a
four-phase convergence pattern: (i) an initial uniform phase, (ii) a
sharp-convergence phase, (iii) a sharp-divergence phase, and (iv) a
slow-reconvergence phase. Further, we observe that larger models reconverge
faster in later training stages, while smaller models never actually
reconverge; these results suggest that a certain model size may be necessary to
learn stable distributions. Restricting our analysis to specific token
frequencies or part-of-speech (PoS) tags further reveals that convergence is
uneven across linguistic categories: frequent tokens and function words
converge faster and more reliably than their counterparts (infrequent tokens
and content words). Overall, our findings highlight factors that influence the
stability of the learned distributions in model training.
