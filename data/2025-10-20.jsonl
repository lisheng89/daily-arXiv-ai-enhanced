Managing these embedding sizes can be\nchallenging, leading to bulky models that are harder to deploy and maintain. In\nthis paper, we introduce a method to automatically determine the optimal\nembedding size for ID features, significantly reducing the model size while\nmaintaining performance.\n  Our approach involves defining a custom Keras layer called the dimension mask\nlayer, which sits directly after the embedding lookup. This layer trims the\nembedding vector by allowing only the first N dimensions to pass through. By\ndoing this, we can reduce the input feature dimension by more than half with\nminimal or no loss in model performance metrics. This reduction helps cut down\nthe memory footprint of the model and lowers the risk of overfitting due to\nmulticollinearity.\n  Through offline experiments on public datasets and an online A/B test on a\nreal production dataset, we demonstrate that using a dimension mask layer can\nshrink the effective embedding dimension by 40-50\\%, leading to substantial\nimprovements in memory efficiency.

To address these limitations, this study\nproposes a process-aware framework that enhances FMEA reusability by combining\nmanufacturing-domain conceptualization with graph neural network (GNN)\nreasoning. First, FMEA worksheets from multiple manufacturing lines are\ntransformed into a unified knowledge graph through ontology-guided large\nlanguage model (LLM) extraction, capturing domain concepts such as actions,\nstates, components, and parameters. Second, a Relational Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (RGCN) with the process-aware scoring function learns embeddings that\nrespect both semantic relationships and sequential process flows. Finally, link\nprediction is employed to infer and rank candidate fault causes consistent with\nthe target line's process flow.\n  A case study on automotive pressure sensor assembly lines demonstrates that\nthe proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) baseline (F1@20 = 0.267) and an RGCN approach (0.400),\nachieving the best performance (0.523) in fault cause identification.

A key challenge with these neural Transformer-based models is\nthat they often struggle to generalize beyond the specific tasks and domains\nthey were trained on. To address this challenge, prior research in IR\nincorporated the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework within each Transformer\nlayer of a DRM, which, though effective, substantially increased the number of\nadditional parameters. In this paper, we propose a more efficient design, which\nintroduces a single MoE block (SB-MoE) after the final Transformer layer. To\nassess the retrieval effectiveness of SB-MoE, we perform an empirical\nevaluation across three IR tasks. Our experiments involve two evaluation\nsetups, aiming to assess both in-domain effectiveness and the model's zero-shot\ngeneralizability. In the first setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE with four different\nunderlying DRMs on seven IR benchmarks and evaluate them on their respective\ntest sets. In the second setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE on MSMARCO and perform\nzero-shot evaluation on thirteen BEIR datasets. Additionally, we perform\nfurther experiments to analyze the model's dependency on its hyperparameters\n(i.e., the number of employed and activated experts) and investigate how this\nvariation affects SB-MoE's performance. The obtained results show that SB-MoE\nis particularly effective for DRMs with lightweight base models, such as\nTinyBERT and BERT-Small, consistently exceeding standard model fine-tuning\nacross benchmarks.
