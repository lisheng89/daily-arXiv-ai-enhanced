Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了PBR框架，通过用户特定信号在检索前进行个性化查询扩展，解决了现有RAG系统在个性化设置中忽略用户表达风格和语料结构的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有查询扩展方法采用统一策略，忽略了用户特定的语义特征，包括个人表达风格、偏好和历史背景，限制了RAG系统在个性化环境中的泛化能力。

Method: PBR框架包含两个组件：P-PRF使用用户历史生成风格对齐的伪反馈来模拟用户表达风格；P-Anchor通过基于图的用户语料结构对齐来捕捉其语义结构。

Result: 在两个个性化基准测试中，PBR始终优于强基线方法，在PersonaBench上实现了高达10%的性能提升，且在不同检索器上表现一致。

Conclusion: 在检索前建模个性化对于缩小用户自适应RAG系统中的语义差距具有重要价值，PBR框架有效解决了用户表达多样性和语料结构异质性带来的挑战。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) critically depends on effective query
expansion to retrieve relevant information. However, existing expansion methods
adopt uniform strategies that overlook user-specific semantics, ignoring
individual expression styles, preferences, and historical context. In practice,
identical queries in text can express vastly different intentions across users.
This representational rigidity limits the ability of current RAG systems to
generalize effectively in personalized settings. Specifically, we identify two
core challenges for personalization: 1) user expression styles are inherently
diverse, making it difficult for standard expansions to preserve personalized
intent. 2) user corpora induce heterogeneous semantic structures-varying in
topical focus and lexical organization-which hinders the effective anchoring of
expanded queries within the user's corpora space. To address these challenges,
we propose Personalize Before Retrieve (PBR), a framework that incorporates
user-specific signals into query expansion prior to retrieval. PBR consists of
two components: P-PRF, which generates stylistically aligned pseudo feedback
using user history for simulating user expression style, and P-Anchor, which
performs graph-based structure alignment over user corpora to capture its
structure. Together, they produce personalized query representations tailored
for retrieval. Experiments on two personalized benchmarks show that PBR
consistently outperforms strong baselines, with up to 10% gains on PersonaBench
across retrievers. Our findings demonstrate the value of modeling
personalization before retrieval to close the semantic gap in user-adaptive RAG
systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zhang-Yingyi/PBR-code.

*Nan Lu,Yurong Hu,Jiaquan Fang,Yan Liu,Rui Dong,Yiming Wang,Rui Lin,Shaoyi Xu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了SHERLOCK框架，利用大语言模型的推理能力辅助风险调查，通过构建知识库、智能平台和反思优化模块，显著提升了风险分析的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商行业增长加剧了黑产与风控团队的对抗，大量案件分析给风控分析师带来沉重负担，且分析师个体差异阻碍了标准化工作流程的建立。

Method: 1) 从多模态数据提取风控知识构建知识库；2) 基于数据飞轮构建智能平台，整合日常操作、专家标注和模型评估；3) 引入反思优化模块与知识库协作，建立快速响应机制。

Result: 在京东真实交易数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了LLM分析结果的事实对齐和风险定位精度，部署后大幅提升了案件调查流程效率。

Conclusion: SHERLOCK框架有效解决了风控分析中的工作负荷和标准化问题，通过LLM推理能力和系统化方法提升了风险管理的效率和准确性。

Abstract: The growth of the e-commerce industry has intensified the adversarial
dynamics between shadow economy actors and risk management teams. Companies
often conduct risk investigations into suspicious cases to identify emerging
fraud patterns, thereby enhancing both preemptive risk prevention and post-hoc
governance. However, the sheer volume of case analyses imposes a substantial
workload on risk management analysts, as each case requires the integration of
long-term expert experience and meticulous scrutiny across multiple risk
dimensions. Additionally, individual disparities among analysts hinder the
establishment of uniform and high-standard workflows. To address these
challenges, we propose the SHERLOCK framework, which leverages the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to assist analysts in risk
investigations. Our approach consists of three primary components: (1)
extracting risk management knowledge from multi-modal data and constructing a
domain knowledge base (KB), (2) building an intelligent platform guided by the
data flywheel paradigm that integrates daily operations, expert annotations,
and model evaluations, with iteratively fine-tuning for preference alignment,
and (3) introducing a Reflect & Refine (R&R) module that collaborates with the
domain KB to establish a rapid response mechanism for evolving risk patterns.
Experiments conducted on the real-world transaction dataset from JD.com
demonstrate that our method significantly improves the precision of both
factual alignment and risk localization within the LLM analysis results.
Deployment of the SHERLOCK-based LLM system on JD.com has substantially
enhanced the efficiency of case investigation workflows for risk managers.

### [3] [Rethinking Reasoning in Document Ranking: Why Chain-of-Thought Falls Short](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08985)
*Xuan Lu,Haohang Huang,Rui Meng,Yaohui Jin,Wenjun Zeng,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究推理在文档重排序中的作用，发现在点式和列表式重排序中，加入推理链的模型表现均不如直接预测排名的模型，且推理成本更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型促使研究者将显式推理链引入LLM重排序器，但推理对排序任务的有效性尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 在点式和列表式重排序设置下，通过监督微调和强化学习，使用包括BRIGHT推理密集型数据集和BEIR标准IR基准在内的多样化基准进行系统研究。

Result: 推理增强的重排序器在点式设置中破坏校准并偏向正类，在列表式设置中提高域内拟合但增加方差且无法泛化到域外，直接微调的重排序器更稳定有效。

Conclusion: 显式推理并非普遍有益于重排序，未来方向包括点式重排序器的校准感知评分和设计简洁、有针对性的推理策略以减轻列表式重排序中的过拟合和过度思考。

Abstract: Document reranking is a key component in information retrieval (IR), aimed at
refining initial retrieval results to improve ranking quality for downstream
tasks. Recent studies--motivated by large reasoning models (LRMs)--have begun
incorporating explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into LLM-based
rerankers. However, the effectiveness of such reasoning for ranking tasks
remains underexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study of
reasoning in reranking across both pointwise and listwise settings, under both
supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Using diverse benchmarks,
including reasoning-intensive datasets (BRIGHT) and standard IR benchmarks
(BEIR), we find that reasoning-augmented rerankers consistently underperform
their direct counterparts that predict rankings without CoT, despite
substantially higher inference costs. Our analysis reveals three core
limitations: (i) in pointwise rerankers, reasoning breaks calibration and
biases models toward the positive class, raising TPR but lowering TNR, which
inflates false positives and degrades ranking in negative-dominant pools; (ii)
in listwise rerankers, reasoning improves in-domain fit but increases variance
and fails to generalize out-of-domain, even when reinforcement learning
shortens rationales; and (iii) overall, directly fine-tuned rerankers remain
more stable, effective, and robust. These findings challenge the assumption
that explicit reasoning is universally beneficial for reranking. We conclude by
highlighting future directions, including calibration-aware scoring for
pointwise rerankers and the design of concise, targeted reasoning strategies to
mitigate overfitting and overthinking in listwise rerankers.

### [4] [Generative Data Augmentation in Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09129)
*Yansong Wang,Qihui Lin,Junjie Huang,Tao Jia*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出GDA4Rec框架，使用生成式数据增强和图对比学习来改进推荐系统，通过生成高质量增强视图和提取物品互补矩阵来学习更有效的嵌入表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法中的随机数据增强会改变原始语义信息，需要生成更高质量的增强视图来提供鲁棒的自监督信号。

Method: 使用深度生成模型近似原始数据分布进行数据增强，提取物品互补矩阵表征物品间潜在关联，结合推荐、数据增强和对比学习的联合目标函数。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的广泛实验证明了模型优越性。

Conclusion: GDA4Rec框架能够生成高质量增强视图，提供有效自监督信号，学习到更有效和信息丰富的嵌入表示。

Abstract: Recommendation systems have become indispensable in various online platforms,
from e-commerce to streaming services. A fundamental challenge in this domain
is learning effective embeddings from sparse user-item interactions. While
contrastive learning has recently emerged as a promising solution to this
issue, generating augmented views for contrastive learning through most
existing random data augmentation methods often leads to the alteration of
original semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
GDA4Rec (Generative Data Augmentation in graph contrastive learning for
Recommendation) to generate high-quality augmented views and provide robust
self-supervised signals. Specifically, we employ a noise generation module that
leverages deep generative models to approximate the distribution of original
data for data augmentation. Additionally, GDA4Rec further extracts an item
complement matrix to characterize the latent correlations between items and
provide additional self-supervised signals. Lastly, a joint objective that
integrates recommendation, data augmentation and contrastive learning is used
to enforce the model to learn more effective and informative embeddings.
Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets to demonstrate the
superiority of the model. The code is available at:

### [5] [Controlled Personalization in Legacy Media Online Services: A Case Study in News Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09136)
*Marlene Holzleitner,Stephan Leitner,Hanna Lind Jorgensen,Christoph Schmitz,Jacob Welander,Dietmar Jannach*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 传统新闻媒体采用受控个性化策略，在保持编辑价值观的同时引入算法推荐，A/B测试显示能显著提升点击率、内容多样性和降低流行度偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统新闻媒体在采用个性化推荐技术时面临平衡技术创新与核心编辑价值观的挑战，需要找到既能提升用户体验又不违背新闻原则的方法。

Method: 在挪威主要传统新闻机构的网站上进行了A/B测试，比较受控个性化策略与传统编辑推荐的效果。

Result: 个性化内容显著提高了点击率，减少了用户导航努力，提升了内容多样性和目录覆盖率，同时降低了流行度偏见。

Conclusion: 受控个性化能够成功协调用户需求与编辑目标，为传统媒体采用个性化技术同时维护新闻价值观提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Personalized news recommendations have become a standard feature of large
news aggregation services, optimizing user engagement through automated content
selection. In contrast, legacy news media often approach personalization
cautiously, striving to balance technological innovation with core editorial
values. As a result, online platforms of traditional news outlets typically
combine editorially curated content with algorithmically selected articles - a
strategy we term controlled personalization. In this industry paper, we
evaluate the effectiveness of controlled personalization through an A/B test
conducted on the website of a major Norwegian legacy news organization. Our
findings indicate that even a modest level of personalization yields
substantial benefits. Specifically, we observe that users exposed to
personalized content demonstrate higher click-through rates and reduced
navigation effort, suggesting improved discovery of relevant content. Moreover,
our analysis reveals that controlled personalization contributes to greater
content diversity and catalog coverage and in addition reduces popularity bias.
Overall, our results suggest that controlled personalization can successfully
align user needs with editorial goals, offering a viable path for legacy media
to adopt personalization technologies while upholding journalistic values.

### [6] [Hierarchical Semantic RL: Tackling the Problem of Dynamic Action Space for RL-based Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09167)
*Minmao Wang,Xingchen Liu,Shijie Yi,Likang Wu,Hongke Zhao,Fei Pan,Qingpeng Cai,Peng Jiang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: HSRL通过引入固定语义动作空间和分层策略网络，解决了推荐系统中强化学习面临的大规模动态动作空间问题，在公开基准和工业部署中均取得显著效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统大多优化短期参与度，而基于强化学习的长期价值建模面临大规模动态动作空间的挑战，导致策略学习不稳定。

Method: 提出分层语义强化学习(HSRL)，使用语义ID编码物品构建固定语义动作空间，通过分层策略网络进行粗到细的决策，并采用多级评论家进行细粒度信用分配。

Result: 在公开基准和工业数据集上均超越现有最优方法，在线A/B测试中实现18.421%的转化率提升，成本仅增加1.251%。

Conclusion: HSRL为基于强化学习的推荐系统提供了一个可扩展的范式，有效解决了大规模动作空间带来的训练不稳定问题。

Abstract: Recommender Systems (RS) are fundamental to modern online services. While
most existing approaches optimize for short-term engagement, recent work has
begun to explore reinforcement learning (RL) to model long-term user value.
However, these efforts face significant challenges due to the vast, dynamic
action spaces inherent in recommendation, which hinder stable policy learning.
To resolve this bottleneck, we introduce Hierarchical Semantic RL (HSRL), which
reframes RL-based recommendation over a fixed Semantic Action Space (SAS). HSRL
encodes items as Semantic IDs (SIDs) for policy learning, and maps SIDs back to
their original items via a fixed, invertible lookup during execution. To align
decision-making with SID generation, the Hierarchical Policy Network (HPN)
operates in a coarse-to-fine manner, employing hierarchical residual state
modeling to refine each level's context from the previous level's residual,
thereby stabilizing training and reducing representation-decision mismatch. In
parallel, a Multi-level Critic (MLC) provides token-level value estimates,
enabling fine-grained credit assignment. Across public benchmarks and a
large-scale production dataset from a leading Chinese short-video advertising
platform, HSRL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. In online
deployment over a seven-day A/B testing, it delivers an 18.421% CVR lift with
only a 1.251% increase in cost, supporting HSRL as a scalable paradigm for
RL-based recommendation. Our code is released at
https://github.com/MinmaoWang/HSRL.

### [7] [ChoirRec: Semantic User Grouping via LLMs for Conversion Rate Prediction of Low-Activity Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09393)
*Dakai Zhai,Jiong Gao,Boya Du,Junwei Xu,Qijie Shen,Jialin Zhu,Yuning Jiang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ChoirRec是一个利用大语言模型构建语义用户群组来提升低活跃用户转化率预测的新框架，通过双通道架构实现跨用户知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在低活跃用户CVR预测中的三个关键局限：依赖噪声行为信号、用户级信息不足、训练偏向高活跃用户。

Method: 采用双通道架构，包含三个组件：语义群组生成模块（利用LLM形成跨活跃度用户集群）、群组感知分层表示模块（丰富稀疏用户嵌入）、群组感知多粒度模块（双通道架构和自适应融合机制）。

Result: 在淘宝平台上的实验显示，离线评估GAUC提升1.16%，在线A/B测试订单量增长7.24%。

Conclusion: ChoirRec在工业级电商平台上展现出显著的实际应用价值，有效提升了低活跃用户的转化率预测性能。

Abstract: Accurately predicting conversion rates (CVR) for low-activity users remains a
fundamental challenge in large-scale e-commerce recommender systems.Existing
approaches face three critical limitations: (i) reliance on noisy and
unreliable behavioral signals; (ii) insufficient user-level information due to
the lack of diverse interaction data; and (iii) a systemic training bias toward
high-activity users that overshadows the needs of low-activity users.To address
these challenges, we propose ChoirRec, a novel framework that leverages the
semantic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct semantic
user groups and enhance CVR prediction for low-activity users.With a
dual-channel architecture designed for robust cross-user knowledge transfer,
ChoirRec comprises three components: (i) a Semantic Group Generation module
that utilizes LLMs to form reliable, cross-activity user clusters, thereby
filtering out noisy signals; (ii) a Group-aware Hierarchical Representation
module that enriches sparse user embeddings with informative group-level priors
to mitigate data insufficiency; and (iii) a Group-aware Multi-granularity
Modual that employs a dual-channel architecture and adaptive fusion mechanism
to ensure effective learning and utilization of group knowledge. We conduct
extensive offline and online experiments on Taobao, a leading industrial-scale
e-commerce platform.ChoirRec improves GAUC by 1.16\% in offline evaluations,
while online A/B testing reveals a 7.24\% increase in order volume,
highlighting its substantial practical value in real-world applications.

### [8] [MRMR: A Realistic and Expert-Level Multidisciplinary Benchmark for Reasoning-Intensive Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09510)
*Siyue Zhang,Yuan Gao,Xiao Zhou,Yilun Zhao,Tingyu Song,Arman Cohan,Anh Tuan Luu,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MRMR是首个专家级多学科多模态检索基准，包含1502个跨23个领域的查询，需要深度推理能力，支持图像-文本交错序列的检索任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索基准缺乏对多学科专业知识、深度推理能力和多模态交错序列的支持，需要构建更真实、更具挑战性的多模态检索评估标准。

Method: 构建包含1502个查询的基准数据集，涵盖23个专业领域，引入矛盾检索新任务，支持多图像查询和混合模态文档，对4类14个前沿多模态检索系统进行评估。

Result: Qwen3-Embedding结合LLM生成的图像描述表现最佳，多模态模型在专业领域查询中表现良好，但在推理密集型任务上仍有不足。

Conclusion: MRMR基准为推进多模态检索在更真实和挑战性场景中的发展铺平了道路，现有模型在推理密集型任务上仍有改进空间。

Abstract: We introduce MRMR, the first expert-level multidisciplinary multimodal
retrieval benchmark requiring intensive reasoning. MRMR contains 1,502 queries
spanning 23 domains, with positive documents carefully verified by human
experts. Compared to prior benchmarks, MRMR introduces three key advancements.
First, it challenges retrieval systems across diverse areas of expertise,
enabling fine-grained model comparison across domains. Second, queries are
reasoning-intensive, with images requiring deeper interpretation such as
diagnosing microscopic slides. We further introduce Contradiction Retrieval, a
novel task requiring models to identify conflicting concepts. Finally, queries
and documents are constructed as image-text interleaved sequences. Unlike
earlier benchmarks restricted to single images or unimodal documents, MRMR
offers a realistic setting with multi-image queries and mixed-modality corpus
documents. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 4 categories of multimodal
retrieval systems and 14 frontier models on MRMR. The text embedding model
Qwen3-Embedding with LLM-generated image captions achieves the highest
performance, highlighting substantial room for improving multimodal retrieval
models. Although latest multimodal models such as Ops-MM-Embedding perform
competitively on expert-domain queries, they fall short on reasoning-intensive
tasks. We believe that MRMR paves the way for advancing multimodal retrieval in
more realistic and challenging scenarios.

### [9] [Doc2Query++: Topic-Coverage based Document Expansion and its Application to Dense Retrieval via Dual-Index Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09557)
*Tzu-Lin Kuo,Wei-Ning Chiu,Wei-Yun Ma,Pu-Jen Cheng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Doc2Query++ 是一个文档扩展框架，通过无监督主题建模和混合关键词选择来指导LLM生成多样化且相关的查询，解决了传统文档扩展方法中的幻觉、冗余和跨域泛化问题，并通过双索引融合策略提升稠密检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文档扩展方法存在生成不可控（产生幻觉或冗余查询）、跨域泛化能力差（如从MS MARCO到BEIR数据集）以及查询拼接带来的噪声问题，特别是在稠密检索中表现不佳。

Method: 1. 使用无监督主题建模推断文档的潜在主题以实现跨域适用性；2. 通过混合关键词选择为每个文档创建多样化且相关的关键词集；3. 指导LLM利用关键词生成查询，确保全面主题表示并减少冗余；4. 提出双索引融合策略，分离文本和查询信号以避免噪声。

Result: Doc2Query++在多个数据集上显著优于现有最佳基线方法，在MAP、nDCG@10和Recall@100等指标上实现了显著提升，适用于稀疏和稠密检索。

Conclusion: Doc2Query++通过结构化查询生成和双索引融合策略，有效解决了文档扩展中的关键挑战，在跨域场景下实现了优异的检索性能。

Abstract: Document expansion (DE) via query generation tackles vocabulary mismatch in
sparse retrieval, yet faces limitations: uncontrolled generation producing
hallucinated or redundant queries with low diversity; poor generalization from
in-domain training (e.g., MS MARCO) to out-of-domain data like BEIR; and noise
from concatenation harming dense retrieval. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
enable cross-domain query generation, basic prompting lacks control, and
taxonomy-based methods rely on domain-specific structures, limiting
applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce Doc2Query++, a DE
framework that structures query generation by first inferring a document's
latent topics via unsupervised topic modeling for cross-domain applicability,
then using hybrid keyword selection to create a diverse and relevant keyword
set per document. This guides LLM not only to leverage keywords, which ensure
comprehensive topic representation, but also to reduce redundancy through
diverse, relevant terms. To prevent noise from query appending in dense
retrieval, we propose Dual-Index Fusion strategy that isolates text and query
signals, boosting performance in dense settings. Extensive experiments show
Doc2Query++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
substantial gains in MAP, nDCG@10 and Recall@100 across diverse datasets on
both sparse and dense retrieval.
