A key challenge lies in exploring\noptimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations. Recent\nresearch follows a two-stage (generator-evaluator) paradigm, where a generator\nproduces multiple feasible sequences, and an evaluator selects the best one. In\npractice, the generator is typically implemented as an autoregressive model.\nHowever, these two-stage methods face two main challenges. First, the\nseparation of the generator and evaluator hinders end-to-end training. Second,\nautoregressive generators suffer from inference efficiency. In this work, we\npropose a Unified Generative Efficient Reranking Framework (GReF) to address\nthe two primary challenges. Specifically, we introduce Gen-Reranker, an\nautoregressive generator featuring a bidirectional encoder and a dynamic\nautoregressive decoder to generate causal reranking sequences. Subsequently, we\npre-train Gen-Reranker on the item exposure order for high-quality parameter\ninitialization. To eliminate the need for the evaluator while integrating\nsequence-level evaluation during training for end-to-end optimization, we\npropose post-training the model through Rerank-DPO. Moreover, for efficient\nautoregressive inference, we introduce ordered multi-token prediction (OMTP),\nwhich trains Gen-Reranker to simultaneously generate multiple future items\nwhile preserving their order, ensuring practical deployment in real-time\nrecommender systems. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that GReF\noutperforms state-of-the-art reranking methods while achieving latency that is\nnearly comparable to non-autoregressive models. Additionally, GReF has also\nbeen deployed in a real-world video app Kuaishou with over 300 million daily\nactive users, significantly improving online recommendation quality."}

However,\nmost of these models complement convolutional filters with self-attention. This\nis because convolutional filters alone, generally fixed filters, struggle to\ncapture global interactions necessary for accurate recommendation. We propose\nTime-Variant Convolutional Filters for Sequential Recommendation (TV-Rec), a\nmodel inspired by graph signal processing, where time-variant graph filters\ncapture position-dependent temporal variations in user sequences. By replacing\nboth fixed kernels and self-attention with time-variant filters, TV-Rec\nachieves higher expressive power and better captures complex interaction\npatterns in user behavior. This design not only eliminates the need for\nself-attention but also reduces computation while accelerating inference.\nExtensive experiments on six public benchmarks show that TV-Rec outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines by an average of 7.49%."}

While significant progress has been made\nin developing advanced and scalable architectures for sequential\nrecommendation(SR) models, there are still challenges due to items'\nmulti-faceted characteristics and dynamic item relevance in the user context.\nTo address these issues, we propose Fuxi-MME, a framework that integrates a\nmulti-embedding strategy with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture.\nSpecifically, to efficiently capture diverse item characteristics in a\ndecoupled manner, we decompose the conventional single embedding matrix into\nseveral lower-dimensional embedding matrices. Additionally, by substituting\nrelevant parameters in the Fuxi Block with an MoE layer, our model achieves\nadaptive and specialized transformation of the enriched representations.\nEmpirical results on public datasets show that our proposed framework\noutperforms several competitive baselines."}

It\ntypically employs the retrieval result as relevance feedback to refine the\nquery and thereby addresses the vocabulary mismatch between user queries and\nrelevant documents. Traditional pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) and its\nvector-based extension (VPRF) improve retrieval performance by leveraging\ntop-retrieved documents as relevance feedback. However, they are constructed\nbased on two major hypotheses: the relevance assumption (top documents are\nrelevant) and the model assumption (rewriting methods need to be designed\nspecifically for particular model architectures). While recent large language\nmodels (LLMs)-based generative relevance feedback (GRF) enables model-free\nquery reformulation, it either suffers from severe LLM hallucination or, again,\nrelies on the relevance assumption to guarantee the effectiveness of rewriting\nquality. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an assumption-relaxed\nframework: \\textit{Generalized Pseudo Relevance Feedback} (GPRF), which\nperforms model-free, natural language rewriting based on retrieved documents,\nnot only eliminating the model assumption but also reducing dependence on the\nrelevance assumption. Specifically, we design a utility-oriented training\npipeline with reinforcement learning to ensure robustness against noisy\nfeedback.

However,\nby ignoring dynamic behavioral properties, purely content-based SIDs have\nlimited expressive power. Existing methods attempt to incorporate behavioral\ninformation but overlook a critical distinction: unlike relatively uniform\ncontent features, user-item interactions are highly skewed and diverse,\ncreating a vast information gap in quality and quantity between popular and\nlong-tail items. This oversight leads to two critical limitations: (1) Noise\nCorruption: Indiscriminate behavior-content alignment allows collaborative\nnoise from long-tail items to corrupt their content representations, leading to\nthe loss of critical multimodal information. (2)Signal Obscurity: The\nequal-weighting scheme for SIDs fails to reflect the varying importance of\ndifferent behavioral signals, making it difficult for downstream tasks to\ndistinguish important SIDs from uninformative ones. To tackle these issues, we\npropose a mixture-of-quantization framework, MMQ-v2, to adaptively Align,\nDenoise, and Amplify multimodal information from content and behavior\nmodalities for semantic IDs learning. The semantic IDs generated by this\nframework named ADA-SID. It introduces two innovations: an adaptive\nbehavior-content alignment that is aware of information richness to shield\nrepresentations from noise, and a dynamic behavioral router to amplify critical\nsignals by applying different weights to SIDs. Extensive experiments on public\nand large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate ADA-SID's significant\nsuperiority in both generative and discriminative recommendation tasks."}
