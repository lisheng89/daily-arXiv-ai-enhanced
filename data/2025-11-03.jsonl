In practice, however,\nretrieval outcomes systematically reflect perspectival biases: deviations\nshaped by linguistic prevalence and cultural associations. We study two such\nbiases. First, prevalence bias refers to the tendency to favor entries from\nprevalent languages over semantically faithful entries in image-to-text\nretrieval. Second, association bias refers to the tendency to favor images\nculturally associated with the query over semantically correct ones in\ntext-to-image retrieval. Results show that explicit alignment is a more\neffective strategy for mitigating prevalence bias. However, association bias\nremains a distinct and more challenging problem. These findings suggest that\nachieving truly equitable multimodal systems requires targeted strategies\nbeyond simple data scaling and that bias arising from cultural association may\nbe treated as a more challenging problem than one arising from linguistic\nprevalence."}

At their core, recommender systems\naddress a fundamental problem: matching users with items. Over the past\ndecades, the field has experienced successive paradigm shifts, from\ncollaborative filtering and matrix factorization in the machine learning era to\nneural architectures in the deep learning era. Recently, the emergence of\ngenerative models, especially large language models (LLMs) and diffusion\nmodels, have sparked a new paradigm: generative recommendation, which\nreconceptualizes recommendation as a generation task rather than discriminative\nscoring. This survey provides a comprehensive examination through a unified\ntripartite framework spanning data, model, and task dimensions. Rather than\nsimply categorizing works, we systematically decompose approaches into\noperational stages-data augmentation and unification, model alignment and\ntraining, task formulation and execution. At the data level, generative models\nenable knowledge-infused augmentation and agent-based simulation while unifying\nheterogeneous signals. At the model level, we taxonomize LLM-based methods,\nlarge recommendation models, and diffusion approaches, analyzing their\nalignment mechanisms and innovations. At the task level, we illuminate new\ncapabilities including conversational interaction, explainable reasoning, and\npersonalized content generation. We identify five key advantages: world\nknowledge integration, natural language understanding, reasoning capabilities,\nscaling laws, and creative generation. We critically examine challenges in\nbenchmark design, model robustness, and deployment efficiency, while charting a\nroadmap toward intelligent recommendation assistants that fundamentally reshape\nhuman-information interaction."}

Text hashing, which projects original texts into compact\nbinary hash codes, is a crucial method for this task. By using binary codes,\nthe semantic similarity computation for text pairs is significantly accelerated\nvia fast Hamming distance calculations, and storage costs are greatly reduced.\nWith the advancement of deep learning, deep text hashing has demonstrated\nsignificant advantages over traditional, data-independent hashing techniques.\nBy leveraging deep neural networks, these methods can learn compact and\nsemantically rich binary representations directly from data, overcoming the\nperformance limitations of earlier approaches. This survey investigates current\ndeep text hashing methods by categorizing them based on their core components:\nsemantic extraction, hash code quality preservation, and other key\ntechnologies. We then present a detailed evaluation schema with results on\nseveral popular datasets, followed by a discussion of practical applications\nand open-source tools for implementation. Finally, we conclude by discussing\nkey challenges and future research directions, including the integration of\ndeep text hashing with large language models to further advance the field.

Collaborative filtering-based RSs rely on\nusers past interactions to generate recommendations. However, when a user is\nnew to the platform, referred to as a cold-start user, there is no historical\ndata available, making it difficult to provide personalized recommendations. To\naddress this, rating elicitation techniques can be used to gather initial\nratings or preferences on selected items, helping to build an early\nunderstanding of the user's tastes. Rating elicitation approaches are generally\ncategorized into two types: non-personalized and personalized. Decision\ntree-based rating elicitation is a personalized method that queries users about\ntheir preferences at each node of the tree until sufficient information is\ngathered. In this paper, we propose an extension to the decision tree approach\nfor rating elicitation in the context of music recommendation. Our method: (i)\nelicits not only item ratings but also preferences on attributes such as genres\nto better cluster users, and (ii) uses item pairs instead of single items at\neach node to more effectively learn user preferences. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that both proposed enhancements lead to improved performance,\nparticularly with a reduced number of queries."}

However, prevailing agentic RAG approaches\nare constrained by a critical limitation: they treat the retrieval process as a\nblack-box querying operation. This confines agents' actions to query issuing,\nhindering its ability to tackle complex information-seeking tasks. To address\nthis, we introduce Interact-RAG, a new paradigm that elevates the LLM agent\nfrom a passive query issuer into an active manipulator of the retrieval\nprocess. We dismantle the black-box with a Corpus Interaction Engine, equipping\nthe agent with a set of action primitives for fine-grained control over\ninformation retrieval. To further empower the agent on the entire RAG pipeline,\nwe first develop a reasoning-enhanced workflow, which enables both zero-shot\nexecution and the synthesis of interaction trajectories. We then leverage this\nsynthetic data to train a fully autonomous end-to-end agent via Supervised\nFine-Tuning (SFT), followed by refinement with Reinforcement Learning (RL).\nExtensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that Interact-RAG\nsignificantly outperforms other advanced methods, validating the efficacy of\nour reasoning-interaction strategy."}
