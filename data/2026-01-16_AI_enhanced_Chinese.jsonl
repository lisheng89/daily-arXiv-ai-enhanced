To better respond real-time user feedback, we have deployed an interactive recommender system (IRS) alongside our core homepage recommender system. This IRS is triggered by user click on homepage, and generates a series of highly relevant recommendations based on the clicked item to meet focused browsing demands. Different from traditional e-commerce RecSys, the full-screen UI and immersive swiping down functionality present two distinct challenges for regular ranking system. First, there exists explicit interference (overlap or conflicts) between ranking objectives, i.e., conversion, view and swipe down. This is because there are intrinsic behavioral co-occurrences under the premise of immersive browsing and swiping down functionality. Second, the ranking system is prone to temporal greedy traps in sequential recommendation slot transitions, which is caused by full-screen UI design. To alleviate these challenges, we propose a novel Spatio-temporal collaborative ranking (STCRank) framework to achieve collaboration between multi-objectives within one slot (spatial) and between multiple sequential recommondation slots. In multi-objective collaboration (MOC) module, we push Pareto frontier by mitigating the objective overlaps and conflicts. In multi-slot collaboration (MSC) module, we achieve global optima on overall sequential slots by dual-stage look-ahead ranking mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed method brings about purchase and DAU co-growth. The proposed system has been already deployed at Kuaishou E-shop since 2025.6.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5feb\u624b\u7535\u5546\u63d0\u51faSTCRank\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u534f\u540c\u6392\u5e8f\u89e3\u51b3\u5168\u5c4f\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0fUI\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u8d2a\u5a6a\u9677\u9631\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d2d\u4e70\u548c\u65e5\u6d3b\u53cc\u589e\u957f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5feb\u624b\u7535\u5546\u5e73\u53f0\u9700\u8981\u5e94\u5bf9\u5168\u5c4fUI\u548c\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u4e0b\u6ed1\u529f\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09\u8f6c\u5316\u3001\u6d4f\u89c8\u3001\u4e0b\u6ed1\u7b49\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u6027\u5e72\u6270\uff08\u91cd\u53e0\u6216\u51b2\u7a81\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u6392\u5e8f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u63a8\u8350\u69fd\u4f4d\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u9677\u5165\u65f6\u5e8f\u8d2a\u5a6a\u9677\u9631\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u7a7a\u534f\u540c\u6392\u5e8f\uff08STCRank\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1\uff09\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u534f\u540c\uff08MOC\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f13\u89e3\u76ee\u6807\u91cd\u53e0\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\u6765\u63a8\u8fdb\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff1b2\uff09\u591a\u69fd\u4f4d\u534f\u540c\uff08MSC\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u524d\u77bb\u6392\u5e8f\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u6574\u4f53\u5e8f\u5217\u69fd\u4f4d\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d2d\u4e70\u548c\u65e5\u6d3b\uff08DAU\uff09\u7684\u5171\u540c\u589e\u957f\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5df2\u4e8e2025\u5e746\u6708\u5728\u5feb\u624b\u7535\u5546\u5e73\u53f0\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0a\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "STCRank\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5168\u5c4f\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u7535\u5546\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u8d2a\u5a6a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Each perturbation is grounded in three intents, including disruptions of popularity, spatial distance, and category diversity. Furthermore, a hybrid evaluation metric is designed to ensure perturbation effectiveness.

RAG systems are often dynamic and may involve multiple rounds of retrieval. While many state-of-the-art retrieval methods are available through academic IR platforms, these platforms are typically designed for the Cranfield paradigm in which all queries are known up front and can be batch processed offline. This simplification accelerates research but leaves state-of-the-art retrieval models unable to support downstream applications that require online services, such as arbitrary dynamic RAG pipelines that involve looping, feedback, or even self-organizing agents. In this work, we introduce RoutIR, a Python package that provides a simple and efficient HTTP API that wraps arbitrary retrieval methods, including first stage retrieval, reranking, query expansion, and result fusion. By providing a minimal JSON configuration file specifying the retrieval models to serve, RoutIR can be used to construct and query retrieval pipelines on-the-fly using any permutation of available models (e.g., fusing the results of several first-stage retrieval methods followed by reranking). The API automatically performs asynchronous query batching and caches results by default. While many state-of-the-art retrieval methods are already supported by the package, RoutIR is also easily expandable by implementing the Engine abstract class.
