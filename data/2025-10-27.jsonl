While\nCross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) models two-domain interactions,\nMulti-Domain Sequential Recommendation (MDSR) introduces significantly more\ndomain transitions, compounded by challenges such as domain heterogeneity and\nimbalance. Existing approaches often overlook the intricacies of domain\ntransitions, tend to overfit to dense domains while underfitting sparse ones,\nand struggle to scale effectively as the number of domains increases.

Extensive experiments on JD and Amazon\ndatasets demonstrate that GMFlowRec achieves state-of-the-art performance with\nup to 44\\% improvement in NDCG@5, while maintaining high efficiency via a\nsingle unified backbone, making it scalable for real-world multi-domain\nsequential recommendation."}

This technology has helped the population cope with\nsocialization and communication needs. Many applications have been developed to\nenhance the communication capabilities of non-verbal autistic children. This\nthesis project proposes the development of a platform that includes a web panel\nand an Android mobile application to assist non-verbal autistic children in\ncommunication, especially in Oman. Different interventions have been merged to\nimprove the quality of life for people on the autism spectrum. The main problem\nidentified in this case is that fragmented approaches are not suitable for\nautistic children.

Yet, current multimodal conversational\nrecommendation datasets remain limited: existing resources either simulate\nconversations, omit user history, or fail to collect sufficiently detailed\nfeedback, all of which constrain the types of research and evaluation they\nsupport.\n  To address these gaps, we introduce VOGUE, a novel dataset of 60 humanhuman\ndialogues in realistic fashion shopping scenarios. Each dialogue is paired with\na shared visual catalogue, item metadata, user fashion profiles and histories,\nand post-conversation ratings from both Seekers and Assistants. This design\nenables rigorous evaluation of conversational inference, including not only\nalignment between predicted and ground-truth preferences, but also calibration\nagainst full rating distributions and comparison with explicit and implicit\nuser satisfaction signals.\n  Our initial analyses of VOGUE reveal distinctive dynamics of visually\ngrounded dialogue. For example, recommenders frequently suggest items\nsimultaneously in feature-based groups, which creates distinct conversational\nphases bridged by Seeker critiques and refinements. Benchmarking multimodal\nlarge language models against human recommenders shows that while MLLMs\napproach human-level alignment in aggregate, they exhibit systematic\ndistribution errors in reproducing human ratings and struggle to generalize\npreference inference beyond explicitly discussed items. These findings\nestablish VOGUE as both a unique resource for studying multimodal\nconversational systems and as a challenge dataset beyond the current\nrecommendation capabilities of existing top-tier multimodal foundation models\nsuch as GPT-4o-mini, GPT-5-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash."}

Existing approaches often treat these\ncomponents separately--either sequentially or in alternation--overlooking their\ninterdependence. This separation can lead to misalignment: the tokenizer is\ntrained without direct guidance from the recommendation objective, potentially\nyielding suboptimal identifiers that degrade recommendation performance.\n  To address this, we propose BLOGER, a Bi-Level Optimization for GEnerative\nRecommendation framework, which explicitly models the interdependence between\nthe tokenizer and the recommender in a unified optimization process. The lower\nlevel trains the recommender using tokenized sequences, while the upper level\noptimizes the tokenizer based on both the tokenization loss and recommendation\nloss. We adopt a meta-learning approach to solve this bi-level optimization\nefficiently, and introduce gradient surgery to mitigate gradient conflicts in\nthe upper-level updates, thereby ensuring that item identifiers are both\ninformative and recommendation-aligned.

Despite these\nbenefits, existing tokenization methods are static and non-personalized. They\ntypically derive semantic IDs solely from item features, assuming a universal\nitem similarity that overlooks user-specific perspectives. However, under the\nautoregressive paradigm, semantic IDs with the same prefixes always receive\nsimilar probabilities, so a single fixed mapping implicitly enforces a\nuniversal item similarity standard across all users. In practice, the same item\nmay be interpreted differently depending on user intentions and preferences. To\naddress this issue, we propose a personalized context-aware tokenizer that\nincorporates a user's historical interactions when generating semantic IDs.\nThis design allows the same item to be tokenized into different semantic IDs\nunder different user contexts, enabling GR models to capture multiple\ninterpretive standards and produce more personalized predictions.

Specifically, the attention-based model\noutperforms other RNN-based and Markov chains-based models by capturing both\nshort- and long-term dependencies more effectively. However, solely focusing on\nitem co-occurrences overlooks the underlying motivations behind user behaviors,\nleading to spurious correlations and potentially inaccurate recommendations. To\naddress this limitation, we present a novel framework that integrates causal\nattention for sequential recommendation, CausalRec. It incorporates a causal\ndiscovery block and a CausalBooster. The causal discovery block learns the\ncausal graph in user behavior sequences, and we provide a theory to guarantee\nthe identifiability of the learned causal graph. The CausalBooster utilizes the\ndiscovered causal graph to refine the attention mechanism, prioritizing\nbehaviors with causal significance. Experimental evaluations on real-world\ndatasets indicate that CausalRec outperforms several state-of-the-art methods,\nwith average improvements of 7.21% in Hit Rate (HR) and 8.65% in Normalized\nDiscounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst model to incorporate causality through the attention mechanism in\nsequential recommendation, demonstrating the value of causality in generating\nmore accurate and reliable recommendations."}
