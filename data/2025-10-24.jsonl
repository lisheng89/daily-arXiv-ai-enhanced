First presented at the \"Digital Humanities and\n  Artificial Intelligence\" conference at the University of Reading on 17 June\n  2024", "summary": "This paper presents a novel methodology for classifying early modern\nreligious images by using Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases in\ncombination with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The approach leverages\nthe full-page context of book illustrations from the Holy Roman Empire,\nallowing the LLM to generate detailed descriptions that incorporate both visual\nand textual elements. These descriptions are then matched to relevant Iconclass\ncodes through a hybrid vector search. This method achieves 87% and 92%\nprecision at five and four levels of classification, significantly\noutperforming traditional image and keyword-based searches. By employing\nfull-page descriptions and RAG, the system enhances classification accuracy,\noffering a powerful tool for large-scale analysis of early modern visual\narchives. This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates the growing potential of\nLLMs and RAG in advancing research within art history and digital humanities."}

Yet, aligning LLMs to the recommendation task remains\nchallenging: pretrained LLMs often generate out-of-catalog items, violate\nrequired output formats, and their ranking quality degrades sharply toward the\nend of the generated list. To this end, we propose ConvRec-R1, a two-stage\nframework for end-to-end training of LLM-based conversational recommender\nsystems. In Stage 1, we construct a behavioral-cloning dataset with a\nRemap-Reflect-Adjust pipeline, which produces high-quality, catalog-grounded\ndemonstrations from powerful blackbox LLMs to warm-start the RL training. In\nStage 2, we propose Rank-GRPO, a principled extension of group relative policy\noptimization (GRPO) tailored to tasks with rank-style outputs. Rank-GRPO treats\neach rank in the recommendation list as the unit instead of token (too\nfine-grained) or sequence (too coarse), redefining rewards to remove non-causal\ncredit assignment and introducing a rank-level importance ratio based on the\ngeometric mean of rank-wise token probabilities to stabilize policy updates.\nExperiments on the public Reddit-v2 dataset show that ConvRec-R1 converges\nfaster and achieves higher Recall and NDCG than GRPO-style baselines.

However, the dynamic nature of\nuser interests and content poses a significant challenge: While initial\nfine-tuning aligns LLMs with domain knowledge and user preferences, it fails to\ncapture such real-time changes, necessitating robust update mechanisms. This\npaper investigates strategies for updating LLM-powered recommenders, focusing\non the trade-offs between ongoing fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG). Using an LLM-powered user interest exploration system as a\ncase study, we perform a comparative analysis of these methods across\ndimensions like cost, agility, and knowledge incorporation. We propose a hybrid\nupdate strategy that leverages the long-term knowledge adaptation of periodic\nfine-tuning with the agility of low-cost RAG.

Unlike\npast media shifts, from live performance to recordings, downloads, and\nstreaming, AI transforms the entire lifecycle of music, collapsing boundaries\nbetween creation, distribution, and monetization. However, existing streaming\nsystems, with opaque and concentrated royalty flows, are ill-equipped to handle\nthe scale and complexity of AI-driven production. We propose a content-based\nMusic AI Agent architecture that embeds attribution directly into the creative\nworkflow through block-level retrieval and agentic orchestration. Designed for\niterative, session-based interaction, the system organizes music into granular\ncomponents (Blocks) stored in BlockDB; each use triggers an Attribution Layer\nevent for transparent provenance and real-time settlement. This framework\nreframes AI from a generative tool into infrastructure for a Fair AI Media\nPlatform. By enabling fine-grained attribution, equitable compensation, and\nparticipatory engagement, it points toward a post-streaming paradigm where\nmusic functions not as a static catalog but as a collaborative and adaptive\necosystem."}

Their\neffectiveness depends on how the model represents where an interaction event\noccurs in the sequence (discrete index) and when it occurred in wall-clock\ntime. Prevailing approaches inject time via learned embeddings or relative\nattention biases. In this paper, we argue that RoPE-based approaches, if\ndesigned properly, can be a stronger alternative for jointly modeling temporal\nand sequential information in user behavior sequences. While vanilla RoPE in\nLLMs considers only token order, generative recommendation requires\nincorporating both event time and token index. To address this, we propose\nTime-and-Order RoPE (TO-RoPE), a family of rotary position embedding designs\nthat treat index and time as angle sources shaping the query-key geometry\ndirectly. We present three instantiations: early fusion, split-by-dim, and\nsplit-by-head. Extensive experiments on both publicly available datasets and a\nproprietary industrial dataset show that TO-RoPE variants consistently improve\naccuracy over existing methods for encoding time and index. These results\nposition rotary embeddings as a simple, principled, and deployment-friendly\nfoundation for generative recommendation."}

This work explores how to build GRRMs by adapting\npre-trained LLMs, which achieves a unified understanding-reasoning-prediction\nmanner for recommendation tasks. We propose GREAM, an end-to-end framework that\nintegrates three components: (i) Collaborative-Semantic Alignment, which fuses\nheterogeneous textual evidence to construct semantically consistent, discrete\nitem indices and auxiliary alignment tasks that ground linguistic\nrepresentations in interaction semantics; (ii) Reasoning Curriculum Activation,\nwhich builds a synthetic dataset with explicit Chain-of-Thought supervision and\na curriculum that progresses through behavioral evidence extraction, latent\npreference modeling, intent inference, recommendation formulation, and denoised\nsequence rewriting; and (iii) Sparse-Regularized Group Policy Optimization\n(SRPO), which stabilizes post-training via Residual-Sensitive Verifiable Reward\nand Bonus-Calibrated Group Advantage Estimation, enabling end-to-end\noptimization under verifiable signals despite sparse successes. GREAM natively\nsupports two complementary inference modes: Direct Sequence Recommendation for\nhigh-throughput, low-latency deployment, and Sequential Reasoning\nRecommendation that first emits an interpretable reasoning chain for causal\ntransparency. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate consistent gains over\nstrong baselines, providing a practical path toward verifiable-RL-driven LLM\nrecommenders."}
