Each datapoint includes a personal vote (first-order signal) and a meta-prediction of how others will vote (second-order signal), allowing richer modeling than traditional datasets that capture only individual preferences. SP-Rank contains over 12,000 human-generated datapoints across three domains -- geography, movies, and paintings, and spans nine elicitation formats with varying subset sizes. This structure enables empirical analysis of preference aggregation when expert identities are unknown but presumed to exist, and individual votes represent noisy estimates of a shared ground-truth ranking. We benchmark SP-Rank by comparing traditional aggregation methods that use only first-order votes against SP-Voting, a second-order method that jointly reasons over both signals to infer ground-truth rankings. While SP-Rank also supports models that rely solely on second-order predictions, our benchmarks emphasize the gains from combining both signals. We evaluate performance across three core tasks: (1) full ground-truth rank recovery, (2) subset-level rank recovery, and (3) probabilistic modeling of voter behavior. Results show that incorporating second-order signals substantially improves accuracy over vote-only methods. Beyond social choice, SP-Rank supports downstream applications in learning-to-rank, extracting expert knowledge from noisy crowds, and training reward models in preference-based fine-tuning pipelines. We release the dataset, code, and baseline evaluations (available at https://github.com/amrit19/SP-Rank-Dataset ) to foster research in human preference modeling, aggregation theory, and human-AI alignment."}

However, traditional RAG methods rely on fragment-level retrieval, limiting their ability to address query-focused summarization queries. GraphRAG introduces a graph-based paradigm for global knowledge reasoning, yet suffers from inefficiencies in information extraction, costly resource consumption, and poor adaptability to incremental updates. To overcome these limitations, we propose TagRAG, a tag-guided hierarchical knowledge graph RAG framework designed for efficient global reasoning and scalable graph maintenance. TagRAG introduces two key components: (1) Tag Knowledge Graph Construction, which extracts object tags and their relationships from documents and organizes them into hierarchical domain tag chains for structured knowledge representation, and (2) Tag-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which retrieves domain-centric tag chains to localize and synthesize relevant knowledge during inference. This design significantly adapts to smaller language models, improves retrieval granularity, and supports efficient knowledge increment. Extensive experiments on UltraDomain datasets spanning Agriculture, Computer Science, Law, and cross-domain settings demonstrate that TagRAG achieves an average win rate of 95.41\\% against baselines while maintaining about 14.6x construction and 1.9x retrieval efficiency compared with GraphRAG."}

To improve user experience, an effective trending query detection method is urgently needed to enable differentiated processing of such target traffic. However, current research on trending detection tailored to the dialogue system scenario remains largely unexplored, and methods designed for traditional search engines often underperform in conversational contexts due to radically distinct query distributions and expression patterns. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-stage framework for trending detection, which achieves systematic optimization from both offline generation and online identification perspectives. Specifically, our framework first exploits selected hot events to generate index queries, establishing a key bridge between static events and dynamic user queries. It then employs a retrieval matching mechanism for real-time online detection of trending queries, where we introduce a cascaded recall and ranking architecture to balance detection efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, to better adapt to the practical application scenario, our framework adopts a single-recall module as a cold-start strategy to collect online data for fine-tuning the reranker. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baseline methods in both offline evaluations and online A/B tests, and user satisfaction is relatively improved by 27\\% in terms of positive-negative feedback ratio."}

To overcome this limitation, we propose a simplified yet effective framework that leverages prompt engineering with Chain-of-Thought task decomposition to guide reasoning within a single large language model. Specifically, our approach decomposes the relevance judgment process into four interpretable subtasks: translation, intent understanding, category matching, and relevance judgment -- and fine-tunes a base model (Qwen2.5-14B) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient adaptation. This design not only reduces computational and storage overhead but also enhances interpretability by explicitly structuring the model's reasoning path. Experimental results show that our single-model framework achieves competitive accuracy and high inference efficiency, processing 20 samples per second on a single A100 GPU. In the CIKM 2025 AnalytiCup Competition Proposals, our method achieved 0.8902 on the public leaderboard and 0.8889 on the private leaderboard, validating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.

A key gap in current RAG evaluation is the lack of a metric to quantify the contribution of individual retrieved documents to the final output. To address this, we introduce the Influence Score (IS), a novel metric based on Partial Information Decomposition that measures the impact of each retrieved document on the generated response. We validate IS through two experiments. First, a poison attack simulation across three datasets demonstrates that IS correctly identifies the malicious document as the most influential in $86\\%$ of cases. Second, an ablation study shows that a response generated using only the top-ranked documents by IS is consistently judged more similar to the original response than one generated from the remaining documents. These results confirm the efficacy of IS in isolating and quantifying document influence, offering a valuable tool for improving the transparency and reliability of RAG systems."}

However, the increasing volume of user-generated reviews has led to information overload, making it difficult for consumers to identify content that aligns with their specific preferences. Existing review ranking systems typically rely on metrics such as helpfulness votes, star ratings, and recency, but these fail to capture individual user interests and often treat textual sentiment and rating signals separately. This research addresses these limitations by proposing a personalized framework that integrates review ranking and abstractive summarization to enhance decision-making efficiency. The proposed system begins by modeling each user's sentiment through a hybrid analysis of star ratings and review content. Simultaneously, user preferences were derived from historical reviews using sentence embeddings and clustering, forming semantic profiles aligned with thematic and sentiment dimensions. A relevance scoring algorithm matched these profiles with unseen reviews based on sentiment and aspect similarity. Top-matched reviews were then summarized to reflect individual interests. A user study with 70 participants demonstrated that the personalized approach improved satisfaction, perceived relevance, and decision-making confidence, while reducing time spent reading. The results highlight the method's effectiveness in alleviating information overload and delivering content tailored to user-specific preferences, emphasizing its value in enhancing user experience in review-rich decision-making environments."}

RAGsemble addresses key limitations of single-model systems by combining the complementary strengths of model families including Gemini (2.0, 2.5, 1.5), OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini), Mistral Large, and Gemma (1B, 4B, 3n-e4b), while grounding outputs in factual data using FAISS-based semantic retrieval.

Our study presents a fast and scalable AI approach for detecting, extracting, and describing illustrations in digitized manuscripts. Focusing on collections like the Vatican Library, our system enables efficient visual analysis across millions of pages. Our pipeline consists of three stages: (1) a fine-tuned image classification model filters out text-only pages; (2) an efficient object detection model identifies and crops illustrations; and (3) a multimodal image captioning model generates concise, human-readable descriptions. These are stored in a searchable database, allowing scholars to retrieve relevant visual materials through keyword queries. By harnessing the power of recent AI advancements, we enable large-scale visual research that was previously impractical, empowering scholars in historical studies, art history, and cultural heritage to explore visual motifs, artistic styles, and cross-cultural influences with new precision and speed. Applying our pipeline to over three million digitized manuscript pages, we automatically identified and extracted more than 200,000 unique illustrations.

We introduce LiveVectorLake, a dual-tier temporal knowledge base architecture that enables real-time semantic search on current knowledge while maintaining complete version history for compliance, auditability, and point-in-time retrieval. The system introduces three core architectural contributions: (1) Content-addressable chunk-level synchronization using SHA-256 hashing for deterministic change detection without external state tracking; (2) Dual-tier storage separating hot-tier vector indices (Milvus with HNSW) from cold-tier columnar versioning (Delta Lake with Parquet), optimizing query latency and storage cost independently; (3) Temporal query routing enabling point-in-time knowledge retrieval via delta-versioning with ACID consistency across tiers. Evaluation on a 100-document corpus versioned across five time points demonstrates: (i) 10-15% re-processing of content during updates compared to 100% for full re-indexing; (ii) sub-100ms retrieval latency on current knowledge; (iii) sub-2s latency for temporal queries across version history; and (iv) storage cost optimization through hot/cold tier separation (only current chunks in expensive vector indices).

Users are often caught in a dilemma: precise natural language descriptions frequently trigger zero-result scenarios, while the forced simplification of queries leads to decision overload from noisy, generic results. To tackle this challenge, we propose LEAPS (LLM-Empowered Adaptive Plugin for Taobao AI Search), which seamlessly upgrades traditional search systems via a \"Broaden-and-Refine\" paradigm. Specifically, it attaches plugins to both ends of the search pipeline: (1) Upstream, a Query Expander acts as an intent translator. It employs a novel three-stage training strategy--inverse data augmentation, posterior-knowledge supervised fine-tuning, and diversity-aware reinforcement learning--to generate adaptive and complementary query combinations that maximize the candidate product set. (2) Downstream, a Relevance Verifier serves as a semantic gatekeeper. By synthesizing multi-source data (e.g., OCR text, reviews) and leveraging chain-of-thought reasoning, it precisely filters noise to resolve selection overload. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate that LEAPS significantly enhances conversational search experiences. Crucially, its non-invasive architecture preserves established retrieval performance optimized for short-text queries, while simultaneously allowing for low-cost integration into diverse back-ends.

Although there is ample evidence to suggest that pretrained LLMs are well-suited for ranking, we find that the vast majority of LLM-based approaches rely on next-token prediction, a loss function which is fundamentally rank-agnostic (and especially so with pointwise supervision). In this paper, we first prove that the expressivity of pointwise generative ranking with multi-token docIDs is superior to that of dual encoders. We then propose SToICaL - a Simple Token-Item Calibrated Loss - which can incorporate rank-aware supervision at both the item and token levels within the pointwise setup. We run a suite of experiments on ranking tasks derived from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and ESCI (Reddy et al., arXiv:2206.06588).

Shane Culpepper", "Joel Mackenzie", "Andrew Yates"], "title": "Revisiting Human-vs-LLM judgments using the TREC Podcast Track", "comment": "The paper has been accepted to appear at ECIR 2026", "summary": "Using large language models (LLMs) to annotate relevance is an increasingly important technique in the information retrieval community. While some studies demonstrate that LLMs can achieve high user agreement with ground truth (human) judgments, other studies have argued for the opposite conclusion. To the best of our knowledge, these studies have primarily focused on classic ad-hoc text search scenarios. In this paper, we conduct an analysis on user agreement between LLM and human experts, and explore the impact disagreement has on system rankings. In contrast to prior studies, we focus on a collection composed of audio files that are transcribed into two-minute segments -- the TREC 2020 and 2021 podcast track. We employ five different LLM models to re-assess all of the query-segment pairs, which were originally annotated by TREC assessors. Furthermore, we re-assess a small subset of pairs where LLM and TREC assessors have the highest disagreement, and found that the human experts tend to agree with LLMs more than with the TREC assessors. Our results reinforce the previous insights of Sormunen in 2002 -- that relying on a single assessor leads to lower user agreement."}

Recently proposed DIME (Dimension IMportance Estimation), provides query-dependent scores to identify informative components of embeddings. DIME relies on a costly grid search to select a priori a dimensionality for all the query corpus's embeddings. Our work provides a statistically grounded criterion that directly identifies the optimal set of dimensions for each query at inference time. Experiments confirm achieving parity of effectiveness and reduces embedding size by an average of $\\sim50\\%$ across different models and datasets at inference time."}
