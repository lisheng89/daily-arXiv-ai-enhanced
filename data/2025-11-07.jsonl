Unlike\ntraditional search engines that present results in ranked lists, GSEs shift\nusers' attention from sequential browsing to content-driven subjective\nperception, driving a paradigm shift in information retrieval. In this context,\nenhancing the subjective visibility of content through Generative Search Engine\nOptimization (G-SEO) methods has emerged as a new research focus. With the\nrapid advancement of Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG)\ntechniques, GSEs can now efficiently integrate text, images, audio, and video,\nproducing richer responses that better satisfy complex information needs.\nExisting G-SEO methods, however, remain limited to text-based optimization and\nfail to fully exploit multimodal data. To address this gap, we propose Caption\nInjection, the first multimodal G-SEO approach, which extracts captions from\nimages and injects them into textual content, integrating visual semantics to\nenhance the subjective visibility of content in generative search scenarios. We\nsystematically evaluate Caption Injection on MRAMG, a benchmark for MRAG, under\nboth unimodal and multimodal settings. Experimental results show that Caption\nInjection significantly outperforms text-only G-SEO baselines under the G-Eval\nmetric, demonstrating the necessity and effectiveness of multimodal integration\nin G-SEO to improve user-perceived content visibility."}

The challenge lies in accurately predicting the correlation between\nqueries and products. Recently, mining the cross-features between queries and\nproducts based on the commonsense reasoning capacity of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) has shown promising performance. However, such methods suffer from high\ncosts due to intensive real-time LLM inference during serving, as well as human\nannotations and potential Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT). To boost efficiency\nwhile leveraging the commonsense reasoning capacity of LLMs for various\ne-commerce tasks, we propose the Efficient Commonsense-Augmented Recommendation\nEnhancer (E-CARE). During inference, models augmented with E-CARE can access\ncommonsense reasoning with only a single LLM forward pass per query by\nutilizing a commonsense reasoning factor graph that encodes most of the\nreasoning schema from powerful LLMs. The experiments on 2 downstream tasks show\nan improvement of up to 12.1% on precision@5."}

Digital tools exist, but there is a serious lack of\ncustomized coaching for newcomers. This paper presents an AI-powered chatbot\nthat will serve as a mentor for the students of BRAC University. The main\ncomponent is a data ingestion pipeline that efficiently processes and updates\ninformation from diverse sources, such as CSV files and university webpages.\nThe chatbot retrieves information through a hybrid approach, combining BM25\nlexical ranking with ChromaDB semantic retrieval, and uses a Large Language\nModel, LLaMA-3.3-70B, to generate conversational responses. The generated text\nwas found to be semantically highly relevant, with a BERTScore of 0.831 and a\nMETEOR score of 0.809. The data pipeline was also very efficient, taking 106.82\nseconds for updates, compared to 368.62 seconds for new data. This chatbot will\nbe able to help students by responding to their queries, helping them to get a\nbetter understanding of university life, and assisting them to plan better\nroutines for their semester in the open-credit university."}

In practice, these lanes rediscover the same candidates, so extra\ncompute does not increase coverage. We present a coordination-free lane\npartitioner that turns duplication into complementary work at the same cost and\ndeadline. For each query we (1) build a deterministic candidate pool sized to\nthe total top-k budget, (2) apply a per-query pseudorandom permutation, and (3)\nassign each lane a disjoint slice of positions. Lanes then return different\nresults by construction, with no runtime coordination.\n  At equal cost with four lanes (total candidate budget 64), on SIFT1M (1M SIFT\nfeature vectors) with Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs (HNSW)\nrecall@10 rises from 0.249 to 0.999 while lane overlap falls from nearly 100%\nto 0%. On MS MARCO (8.8M passages) with HNSW, hit@10 improves from 0.200 to\n0.601 and Mean Reciprocal Rank at 10 (MRR@10) from 0.133 to 0.330. For inverted\nfile (IVF) indexes we see smaller but consistent gains (for example, +11% on MS\nMARCO) by de-duplicating list routing. A microbenchmark shows planner overhead\nof ~37 microseconds per query (mean at the main setting) with linear growth in\nthe number of merged candidates.\n  These results yield a simple operational guideline: size the per-query pool\nto the total budget, deterministically partition positions across lanes, and\nturn redundant fan-out into complementary coverage without changing budget or\ndeadline."}

This may cause\nattenuation of collaborative signals: removing edges between two nodes can\ninterrupt paths between other nodes, weakening path-dependent collaborative\ninformation. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel\nGNN-based CF model called DRCSD for denoising unstable interactions. DRCSD\nincludes two core modules: a collaborative signal decoupling module (decomposes\nsignals into distinct orders by structural characteristics) and an order-wise\ndenoising module (performs targeted denoising on each order). Additionally, the\ninformation aggregation mechanism of traditional GNN-based CF models is\nmodified to avoid cross-order signal interference until the final pooling\noperation. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets show that\nDRCSD has superior robustness against unstable interactions and achieves\nstatistically significant performance improvements in recommendation accuracy\nmetrics compared to state-of-the-art baseline models."}
