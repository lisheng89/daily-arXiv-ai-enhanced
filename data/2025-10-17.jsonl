Rather than synthesizing complete SQL via\ntext-to-SQL, our system routes user requests to a small library of vetted,\nparameterized queries, trading generative flexibility for reliability, low\nlatency, and cost efficiency. We empirically study three questions: (RQ1)\nwhether LLMs alone can reliably recall or extrapolate time-dependent financial\ndata without external retrieval; (RQ2) how well LLMs map company names to stock\nticker symbols; and (RQ3) whether function calling outperforms text-to-SQL for\nend-to-end database query processing. Across controlled experiments on prices\nand fundamentals, LLM-only predictions exhibit non-negligible error and show\nlook-ahead bias primarily for stock prices relative to model knowledge cutoffs.\nTicker-mapping accuracy is near-perfect for NASDAQ-100 constituents and high\nfor S\\&P~500 firms. Finally, FinAI Data Assistant achieves lower latency and\ncost and higher reliability than a text-to-SQL baseline on our task suite.

By computing similarities between query and item\n(product) embeddings, it efficiently selects candidate products from\nlarge-scale repositories. With the breakthroughs in large language models\n(LLMs), mainstream embedding models have gradually shifted from BERT to LLMs\nfor more accurate text modeling. However, these models still adopt\ndirect-embedding methods, and the semantic accuracy of embeddings remains\ninadequate. Therefore, contrastive learning is heavily employed to achieve\ntight semantic alignment between positive pairs. Consequently, such models tend\nto capture statistical co-occurrence patterns in the training data, biasing\nthem toward shallow lexical and semantic matches. For difficult queries\nexhibiting notable lexical disparity from target items, the performance\ndegrades significantly. In this work, we propose the Large Reasoning Embedding\nModel (LREM), which novelly integrates reasoning processes into representation\nlearning. For difficult queries, LREM first conducts reasoning to achieve a\ndeep understanding of the original query, and then produces a\nreasoning-augmented query embedding for retrieval. This reasoning process\neffectively bridges the semantic gap between original queries and target items,\nsignificantly improving retrieval accuracy. Specifically, we adopt a two-stage\ntraining process: the first stage optimizes the LLM on carefully curated\nQuery-CoT-Item triplets with SFT and InfoNCE losses to establish preliminary\nreasoning and embedding capabilities, and the second stage further refines the\nreasoning trajectories via reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive offline and\nonline experiments validate the effectiveness of LREM, leading to its\ndeployment on China's largest e-commerce platform since August 2025."}

Unlike classical dual-tower methods, it generates multiple\nuser representations instead of a single one to model comprehensive user\ninterests. However, prior studies have identified two underlying limitations:\nthe first is interest collapse, where multiple representations homogenize. The\nsecond is insufficient modeling of interest evolution, as they struggle to\ncapture latent interests absent from a user's historical behavior. We begin\nwith a thorough review of existing works in tackling these limitations. Then,\nwe attempt to tackle these limitations from a new perspective. Specifically, we\npropose a framework-level refinement for multi-interest recommendation, named\nGemiRec. The proposed framework leverages interest quantization to enforce a\nstructural interest separation and interest generation to learn the evolving\ndynamics of user interests explicitly. It comprises three modules: (a) Interest\nDictionary Maintenance Module (IDMM) maintains a shared quantized interest\ndictionary. (b) Multi-Interest Posterior Distribution Module (MIPDM) employs a\ngenerative model to capture the distribution of user future interests. (c)\nMulti-Interest Retrieval Module (MIRM) retrieves items using multiple\nuser-interest representations.

To address these limitations, we propose MR.Rec, a novel framework\nthat synergizes memory and reasoning for LLM-based recommendations. To achieve\npersonalization, we develop a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) system that efficiently indexes and retrieves relevant external memory to\nenhance LLM personalization capabilities.

By combining dynamic memory retrieval with adaptive\nreasoning, this approach ensures more accurate, context-aware, and highly\npersonalized recommendations.

However, incorporating\ninconsistent source domain tasks may result in insufficient cross-domain\nmodeling or negative transfer. While incorporating source domain features\nwithout considering the underlying causal relationships may limit their\ncontribution to final predictions. Thus, a natural idea is to directly train a\ncross-domain representation on a causality-labeled dataset from the source to\ntarget domain. Yet this direction has been rarely explored, as identifying\nunbiased real causal labels is highly challenging in real-world scenarios. In\nthis work, we attempt to take a first step in this direction by proposing a\ncausality-enhanced framework, named CE-CDR. Specifically, we first reformulate\nthe cross-domain recommendation as a causal graph for principled guidance. We\nthen construct a causality-aware dataset heuristically. Subsequently, we derive\na theoretically unbiased Partial Label Causal Loss to generalize beyond the\nbiased causality-aware dataset to unseen cross-domain patterns, yielding an\nenriched cross-domain representation, which is then fed into the target model\nto enhance target-domain recommendations.

Five benchmark datasets were\nanalysed in both their unpruned form and at five successive pruning levels (5,\n10, 20, 50, 100). For each coreset, we examined structural and distributional\ncharacteristics and trained and tested eleven representative algorithms. To\nfurther assess if pruned datasets lead to artificially inflated performance\nresults, we also evaluated models trained on the pruned train sets but tested\non unpruned data. Results show that commonly applied core pruning can be highly\nselective, leaving as little as 2% of the original users in some datasets.\nTraditional algorithms achieved higher nDCG@10 scores when both training and\ntesting on pruned data; however, this advantage largely disappeared when\nevaluated on unpruned test sets.
