We provide a different score, aver,\nand observe, on a dataset with ground truth marking for association, that aver\ndoes do better at finding assciated pairs than tf-idf. This example involves\nfinding associated vertices in a large graph and that may be an area where\nneural networks are not currently an obvious best choice. Beyond this one\nanecdote, we observe that (1) aver has a natural threshold for declaring pairs\nas unassociated while tf-idf does not, (2) aver can distinguish between pairs\nof documents for which tf-idf gives a score of 1.0, (3) aver can be applied to\nlarger collections of documents than pairs while tf-idf cannot, and (4) that\naver is derived from entropy under a simple statistical model while tf-idf is a\nconstruction designed to achieve a certain goal and hence aver may be more\n\"natural.\" To be fair, we also observe that (1) writing down and computing the\naver score for a pair is more complex than for tf-idf and (2) that the fact\nthat the aver score is naturally scale-free makes it more complicated to\ninterpret aver scores."}

We introduce the Search-Is-Not-Retrieve (SINR)\nframework, a dual-layer architecture that distinguishes between fine-grained\nsearch representations and coarse-grained retrieval contexts. SINR enhances the\ncomposability, scalability, and context fidelity of retrieval systems by\ndirectly connecting small, semantically accurate search chunks to larger,\ncontextually complete retrieve chunks, all without incurring extra processing\ncosts. This design changes retrieval from a passive step to an active one,\nmaking the system architecture more like how people process information. We\ndiscuss the SINR framework's conceptual foundation, formal structure,\nimplementation issues, and qualitative outcomes. This provides a practical\nfoundation for the next generation of AI systems that use retrieval."}

Hyunkyu Kim and Yeeun Yoo contributed\n  equally to this work", "summary": "As financial applications of large language models (LLMs) gain attention,\naccurate Information Retrieval (IR) remains crucial for reliable AI services.\nHowever, existing benchmarks fail to capture the complex and domain-specific\ninformation needs of real-world banking scenarios. Building domain-specific IR\nbenchmarks is costly and constrained by legal restrictions on using real\ncustomer data. To address these challenges, we propose a systematic methodology\nfor constructing domain-specific IR benchmarks through LLM-based query\ngeneration. As a concrete implementation of this methodology, our pipeline\ncombines single and multi-document query generation with an enhanced and\nreasoning-augmented answerability assessment method, achieving stronger\nalignment with human judgments than prior approaches. Using this methodology,\nwe construct KoBankIR, comprising 815 queries derived from 204 official banking\ndocuments. Our experiments show that existing retrieval models struggle with\nthe complex multi-document queries in KoBankIR, demonstrating the value of our\nsystematic approach for domain-specific benchmark construction and underscoring\nthe need for improved retrieval techniques in financial domains."}

We describe the methodology for dataset\ncreation that enables the expansion of existing Russian Information Retrieval\n(IR) resources. Through extensive experiments, we extend the RusBEIR research\nby comparing lexical retrieval models, such as BM25, with state-of-the-art\nneural architectures fine-tuned for Russian, as well as multilingual models.\nResults of our experiments show that lexical methods tend to outperform neural\nmodels on full-document retrieval, while neural approaches better capture\nlexical semantics in shorter texts, such as in fact-checking or fine-grained\nretrieval. Using our newly created datasets, we also analyze the impact of\ndocument length on retrieval performance and demonstrate that combining\nretrieval with neural reranking consistently improves results. Our contribution\nexpands the resources available for Russian information retrieval research and\nhighlights the importance of accurate evaluation of retrieval models to achieve\noptimal performance.

For flexibility, agentic RAG employs\nautonomous, multi-round retrieval and reasoning to resolve queries. Although\nrecent agentic RAG has improved via reinforcement learning, they often incur\nsubstantial token overhead from search and reasoning processes. This trade-off\nprioritizes accuracy over efficiency. To address this issue, this work proposes\nTeaRAG, a token-efficient agentic RAG framework capable of compressing both\nretrieval content and reasoning steps. 1) First, the retrieved content is\ncompressed by augmenting chunk-based semantic retrieval with a graph retrieval\nusing concise triplets. A knowledge association graph is then built from\nsemantic similarity and co-occurrence. Finally, Personalized PageRank is\nleveraged to highlight key knowledge within this graph, reducing the number of\ntokens per retrieval. 2) Besides, to reduce reasoning steps, Iterative\nProcess-aware Direct Preference Optimization (IP-DPO) is proposed.\nSpecifically, our reward function evaluates the knowledge sufficiency by a\nknowledge matching mechanism, while penalizing excessive reasoning steps. This\ndesign can produce high-quality preference-pair datasets, supporting iterative\nDPO to improve reasoning conciseness. Across six datasets, TeaRAG improves the\naverage Exact Match by 4% and 2% while reducing output tokens by 61% and 59% on\nLlama3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, respectively.
