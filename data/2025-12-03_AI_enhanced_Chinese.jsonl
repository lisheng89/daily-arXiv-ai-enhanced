Recent Transformer-based methods like BERT4Rec have shown strong modeling capability, yet they still rely on discrete item IDs that lack semantic meaning and ignore rich multimodal information (e.g., text and image). This leads to weak generalization and limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose Q-Bert4Rec, a multimodal sequential recommendation framework that unifies semantic representation and quantized modeling. Specifically, Q-Bert4Rec consists of three stages: (1) cross-modal semantic injection, which enriches randomly initialized ID embeddings through a dynamic transformer that fuses textual, visual, and structural features; (2) semantic quantization, which discretizes fused representations into meaningful tokens via residual vector quantization; and (3) multi-mask pretraining and fine-tuning, which leverage diverse masking strategies -- span, tail, and multi-region -- to improve sequential understanding. We validate our model on public Amazon benchmarks and demonstrate that Q-Bert4Rec significantly outperforms many strong existing methods, confirming the effectiveness of semantic tokenization for multimodal sequential recommendation.

Realizing this vision requires not only physical proximity but also efficient and reliable access to information about nearby places, services, and events. Existing location-based systems, however, focus mainly on city-level tasks and neglect the spatial, temporal, and cognitive factors that shape localized decision-making. We conceptualize this gap as the Local Life Information Accessibility (LLIA) problem and introduce AskNearby, an AI-driven community application that unifies retrieval and recommendation within the 15-minute life circle. AskNearby integrates (i) a three-layer Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that synergizes graph-based, semantic-vector, and geographic retrieval with (ii) a cognitive-map model that encodes each user's neighborhood familiarity and preferences. Experiments on real-world community datasets demonstrate that AskNearby significantly outperforms LLM-based and map-based baselines in retrieval accuracy and recommendation quality, achieving robust performance in spatiotemporal grounding and cognitive-aware ranking. Real-world deployments further validate its effectiveness. By addressing the LLIA challenge, AskNearby empowers residents to more effectively discover local resources, plan daily activities, and engage in community life.", "AI": {"tldr": "AskNearby\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u793e\u533a\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u5c42RAG\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5730\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b315\u5206\u949f\u751f\u6d3b\u5708\u5185\u7684\u672c\u5730\u751f\u6d3b\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "15\u5206\u949f\u57ce\u5e02\u613f\u666f\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u7269\u7406\u63a5\u8fd1\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u83b7\u53d6\u9644\u8fd1\u573a\u6240\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u57ce\u5e02\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u672c\u5730\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u672c\u5730\u751f\u6d3b\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u53ca\u6027(LLIA)\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAskNearby\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6574\u5408\uff1a(1)\u4e09\u5c42\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u5730\u7406\u68c0\u7d22\uff1b(2)\u8ba4\u77e5\u5730\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u793e\u533a\u7684\u719f\u6089\u5ea6\u548c\u504f\u597d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u793e\u533a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAskNearby\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u611f\u77e5\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3LLIA\u6311\u6218\uff0cAskNearby\u8d4b\u80fd\u5c45\u6c11\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u53d1\u73b0\u672c\u5730\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u65e5\u5e38\u6d3b\u52a8\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u793e\u533a\u751f\u6d3b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e8615\u5206\u949f\u57ce\u5e02\u613f\u666f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}
