An important capability in e-Commerce with hierarchical taxonomies is to select a set of relevant leaf categories that are semantically aligned with a given user query. In this scope, we address a fundamental problem of search query categorization in real-world e-Commerce taxonomies. A correct categorization of a query not only provides a way to zoom into the correct inventory space, but opens the door to multiple intent understanding capabilities for a query. A practical and accurate solution to this problem has many applications in e-commerce, including constraining retrieved items and improving the relevance of the search results. For this task, we explore a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm that combines simple tree-search with LLM semantic scoring. Assessing its classification performance on human-judged query-category pairs, relevance tests, and LLM-based reference methods, we find that the CoT approach performs better than a benchmark that uses embedding-based query category predictions. We show how the CoT approach can detect problems within a hierarchical taxonomy. Finally, we also propose LLM-based approaches for query-categorization of the same spirit, but which scale better at the range of millions of queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u4e0eLLM\u8bed\u4e49\u8bc4\u5206\u7684CoT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7535\u5546\u641c\u7d22\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u5546\u641c\u7d22\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5e93\u5b58\u8868\u793a\uff08\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff09\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u5206\u7c7b\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6b63\u786e\u5e93\u5b58\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5f00\u542f\u591a\u79cd\u610f\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bf9\u7ea6\u675f\u68c0\u7d22\u9879\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u641c\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b80\u5355\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u4e0eLLM\u8bed\u4e49\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u767e\u4e07\u7ea7\u67e5\u8be2\u7684LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "CoT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5224\u7684\u67e5\u8be2-\u7c7b\u522b\u5bf9\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7c7b\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c42\u6b21\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "CoT\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7535\u5546\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Recent approaches address these issues through two independent directions that leverage large language models (LLMs): (1) generating synthetic queries for fine-tuning, and (2) generating auxiliary contexts to support relevance matching. However, both directions overlook the diverse academic concepts embedded within scientific documents, often producing redundant or conceptually narrow queries and contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce an academic concept index, which extracts key concepts from papers and organizes them guided by an academic taxonomy. This structured index serves as a foundation for improving both directions. First, we enhance the synthetic query generation with concept coverage-based generation (CCQGen), which adaptively conditions LLMs on uncovered concepts to generate complementary queries with broader concept coverage. Second, we strengthen the context augmentation with concept-focused auxiliary contexts (CCExpand), which leverages a set of document snippets that serve as concise responses to the concept-aware CCQGen queries. Extensive experiments show that incorporating the academic concept index into both query generation and context augmentation leads to higher-quality queries, better conceptual alignment, and improved retrieval performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5b66\u672f\u6982\u5ff5\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u805a\u7126\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u9002\u5e94\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9886\u57df\u76f8\u5173\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u4e0e\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5728\u8bcd\u6c47\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u9700\u6c42\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u67e5\u8be2\u6216\u8f85\u52a9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5b66\u672f\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u5197\u4f59\u6216\u6982\u5ff5\u8986\u76d6\u72ed\u7a84\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b66\u672f\u6982\u5ff5\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u4ece\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u6982\u5ff5\u5e76\u6309\u5b66\u672f\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u7d22\u5f15\u5f00\u53d1\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) CCQGen\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u4ee5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8865\u5145\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u6269\u5927\u6982\u5ff5\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\uff1b2) CCExpand\uff1a\u6982\u5ff5\u805a\u7126\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6587\u6863\u7247\u6bb5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\u611f\u77e5\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u7b80\u6d01\u56de\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c06\u5b66\u672f\u6982\u5ff5\u7d22\u5f15\u878d\u5165\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u672f\u6982\u5ff5\u7d22\u5f15\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u805a\u7126\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u5b66\u672f\u6982\u5ff5\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}
