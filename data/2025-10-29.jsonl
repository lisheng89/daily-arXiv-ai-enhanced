The\nCommon Domain Model (CDM) provides a standardized framework for this purpose,\nbut converting complex legal documents like Credit Support Annexes (CSAs) into\nCDM representations remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present\nan extension of the CDMizer framework, a template-driven solution that ensures\nsyntactic correctness and adherence to the CDM schema during contract-to-CDM\nconversion. We apply this extended framework to a real-world task, comparing\nits performance with a benchmark developed by the International Swaps and\nDerivatives Association (ISDA) for CSA clause extraction. Our results show that\nCDMizer, when integrated with a significantly smaller, open-source Large\nLanguage Model (LLM), achieves competitive performance in terms of accuracy and\nefficiency against larger, proprietary models. This work underscores the\npotential of resource-efficient solutions to automate legal contract\ntransformation, offering a cost-effective and scalable approach that can meet\nthe needs of financial institutions with constrained resources or strict data\nprivacy requirements."}

Owing to the massive candidate pool and strict latency constraints,\nindustry systems often rely on lightweight two-tower architectures, which are\ncomputationally efficient yet limited in estimation capability. As a result,\nthey struggle to capture the complex synergistic and suppressive relationships\namong candidate items, which are essential for producing contextually coherent\nand diverse recommendation lists. Moreover, this simplicity further amplifies\nthe Sample Selection Bias (SSB) problem, as coarse-grained models trained on\nbiased exposure data must generalize to a much larger candidate space with\ndistinct distributions.\n  To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{DUET} (\\textbf{DU}al Model\nCo-Training for \\textbf{E}ntire Space C\\textbf{T}R Prediction), a set-wise\npre-ranking framework that achieves expressive modeling under tight\ncomputational budgets. Instead of scoring items independently, DUET performs\nset-level prediction over the entire candidate subset in a single forward pass,\nenabling information-aware interactions among candidates while amortizing the\ncomputational cost across the set. Moreover, a dual model co-training mechanism\nextends supervision to unexposed items via mutual pseudo-label refinement,\neffectively mitigating SSB. Validated through extensive offline experiments and\nonline A/B testing, DUET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines\nand achieves improvements across multiple core business metrics. At present,\nDUET has been fully deployed in Kuaishou and Kuaishou Lite Apps, serving the\nmain traffic for hundreds of millions of users."}

This paper\npresents a systematic investigation of advanced metadata-driven\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, proposing and evaluating a\nnovel, multi-stage RAG architecture that leverages LLM-generated metadata. We\nintroduce a sophisticated indexing pipeline to create contextually rich\ndocument chunks and benchmark a spectrum of enhancements, including\npre-retrieval filtering, post-retrieval reranking, and enriched embeddings,\nbenchmarked on the FinanceBench dataset. Our results reveal that while a\npowerful reranker is essential for precision, the most significant performance\ngains come from embedding chunk metadata directly with text (\"contextual\nchunks\"). Our proposed optimal architecture combines LLM-driven pre-retrieval\noptimizations with these contextual embeddings to achieve superior performance.\nAdditionally, we present a custom metadata reranker that offers a compelling,\ncost-effective alternative to commercial solutions, highlighting a practical\ntrade-off between peak performance and operational efficiency.

Conventional\nrecommenders, dominated by massive embedding tables, tend to plateau as\nembedding dimensions grow. In contrast, the emerging generative paradigm\nreplaces embeddings with compact Semantic ID (SID) sequences produced by\nautoregressive Transformers. Yet most industrial deployments remain\nproprietary, leaving two fundamental questions open: (1) Do the expected\nscaling laws hold on public benchmarks? (2) What is the minimal post-training\nrecipe that enables competitive performance?\n  We present MiniOneRec, to the best of our knowledge, the first fully\nopen-source generative recommendation framework, which provides an end-to-end\nworkflow spanning SID construction, supervised fine-tuning, and\nrecommendation-oriented reinforcement learning. We generate SIDs via a Residual\nQuantized VAE and post-train Qwen backbones ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters\non the Amazon Review dataset. Our experiments reveal a consistent downward\ntrend in both training and evaluation losses with increasing model size,\nvalidating the parameter efficiency of the generative approach. To further\nenhance performance, we propose a lightweight yet effective post-training\npipeline that (1) enforces full-process SID alignment and (2) applies\nreinforcement learning with constrained decoding and hybrid rewards. Together,\nthese techniques yield significant improvements in both ranking accuracy and\ncandidate diversity."}
