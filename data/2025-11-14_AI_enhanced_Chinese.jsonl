However, existing multi-stage advertising recommendation systems suffer from objective misalignment and error propagation, making it difficult to achieve global optimality, while unified generative recommendation models still struggle to meet the demands of practical industrial applications. To address these issues, we propose GPR (Generative Pre-trained Recommender), the first one-model framework that redefines advertising recommendation as an end-to-end generative task, replacing the traditional cascading paradigm with a unified generative approach. To realize GPR, we introduce three key innovations spanning unified representation, network architecture, and training strategy. First, we design a unified input schema and tokenization method tailored to advertising scenarios, mapping both ads and organic content into a shared multi-level semantic ID space, thereby enhancing semantic alignment and modeling consistency across heterogeneous data. Second, we develop the Heterogeneous Hierarchical Decoder (HHD), a dual-decoder architecture that decouples user intent modeling from ad generation, achieving a balance between training efficiency and inference flexibility while maintaining strong modeling capacity. Finally, we propose a multi-stage joint training strategy that integrates Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), Value-Aware Fine-Tuning and the Hierarchy Enhanced Policy Optimization (HEPO) algorithm, forming a complete generative recommendation pipeline that unifies interest modeling, value alignment, and policy optimization. GPR has been fully deployed in the Tencent Weixin Channels advertising system, delivering significant improvements in key business metrics including GMV and CTCVR.", "AI": {"tldr": "GPR\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5c06\u5e7f\u544a\u63a8\u8350\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u5206\u5c42\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5e7f\u544a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u800c\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGPR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1\uff09\u7edf\u4e00\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5e7f\u544a\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u5185\u5bb9\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u8bed\u4e49ID\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b2\uff09\u5f02\u6784\u5206\u5c42\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff08HHD\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5e7f\u544a\u751f\u6210\uff1b3\uff09\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u611f\u77e5\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "GPR\u5df2\u5728\u817e\u8baf\u5fae\u4fe1\u89c6\u9891\u53f7\u5e7f\u544a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5168\u9762\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5728GMV\u548cCTCVR\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u4e1a\u52a1\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "GPR\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e7f\u544a\u63a8\u8350\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u7ea7\u8054\u8303\u5f0f\u5411\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5e7f\u544a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To this end, industrial practitioners have accumulated vast amounts of structured domain knowledge, which we term human priors (e.g., item taxonomies, temporal patterns). This knowledge is typically applied through post-hoc adjustments during ranking or post-ranking. However, this approach remains decoupled from the core model learning, which is particularly undesirable as the industry shifts to end-to-end generative recommendation foundation models. On the other hand, many methods targeting these beyond-accuracy objectives often require architecture-specific modifications and discard these valuable human priors by learning user intent in a fully unsupervised manner.\n  Instead of discarding the human priors accumulated over years of practice, we introduce a backbone-agnostic framework that seamlessly integrates these human priors directly into the end-to-end training of generative recommenders. With lightweight, prior-conditioned adapter heads inspired by efficient LLM decoding strategies, our approach guides the model to disentangle user intent along human-understandable axes (e.g., interaction types, long- vs. short-term interests). We also introduce a hierarchical composition strategy for modeling complex interactions across different prior types. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances both accuracy and beyond-accuracy objectives. We also show that human priors allow the backbone model to more effectively leverage longer context lengths and larger model sizes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u76f4\u63a5\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5934\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u8026\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7b49\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u79ef\u7d2f\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5728\u6392\u5e8f\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u6574\u800c\u4e0e\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u8131\u8282\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u800c\u4e22\u5f03\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b9d\u8d35\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5934\uff0c\u53d7\u9ad8\u6548LLM\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u6cbf\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u4ea4\u4e92\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u5174\u8da3\uff09\u89e3\u8026\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u7ec4\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u540c\u5148\u9a8c\u7c7b\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7b49\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u4f7f\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}
