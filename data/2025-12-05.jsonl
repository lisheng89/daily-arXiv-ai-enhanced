Using twelve authentic advising questions intentionally designed to stress lexical precision, we compared ten personalized and non-personalized system configurations and analyzed outcomes with a Linear Mixed-Effects Model across lexical (BLEU, ROUGE-L), semantic (METEOR, BERTScore), and grounding (RAGAS) metrics. Results showed a consistent trade-off: personalization reliably improved reasoning quality and grounding, yet introduced a significant negative interaction on semantic similarity, driven not by poorer answers but by the limits of current metrics, which penalize meaningful personalized deviations from generic reference texts. This reveals a structural flaw in prevailing LLM evaluation methods, which are ill-suited for assessing user-specific responses. The fully integrated personalized configuration produced the highest overall gains, suggesting that personalization can enhance system effectiveness when evaluated with appropriate multidimensional metrics. Overall, the study demonstrates that personalization produces metric-dependent shifts rather than uniform improvements and provides a methodological foundation for more transparent and robust personalization in agentic AI."}

The UserSimCRS toolkit was introduced to address this gap. In this work, we present UserSimCRS v2, a significant upgrade aligning the toolkit with state-of-the-art research. Key extensions include an enhanced agenda-based user simulator, introduction of large language model-based simulators, integration for a wider range of CRSs and datasets, and new LLM-as-a-judge evaluation utilities. We demonstrate these extensions in a case study."}

However, their tendency to hallucinate and their limitations in spatial retrieval and reasoning are well known, pointing to the need for novel solutions. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a promising way to enhance LLMs with accurate, domain-specific, and timely information. Spatial RAG extends this approach to tasks involving geographic understanding. In this work, we introduce WalkRAG, a spatial RAG-based framework with a conversational interface for recommending walkable urban itineraries. Users can request routes that meet specific spatial constraints and preferences while interactively retrieving information about the path and points of interest (POIs) along the way. Preliminary results show the effectiveness of combining information retrieval, spatial reasoning, and LLMs to support urban discovery."}

However, these methods cannot be applied when the KG contains sensitive data and the user lacks the resources to deploy a local generative LLM. To address this issue, we propose a privacy-aware query generation approach for KGs. Our method identifies sensitive information in the graph based on its structure and omits such values before requesting the LLM to translate natural language questions into Cypher queries. Experimental results show that our approach preserves the quality of the generated queries while preventing sensitive data from being transmitted to third-party services."}
