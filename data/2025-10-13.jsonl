However, existing expansion methods\nadopt uniform strategies that overlook user-specific semantics, ignoring\nindividual expression styles, preferences, and historical context. In practice,\nidentical queries in text can express vastly different intentions across users.\nThis representational rigidity limits the ability of current RAG systems to\ngeneralize effectively in personalized settings. Specifically, we identify two\ncore challenges for personalization: 1) user expression styles are inherently\ndiverse, making it difficult for standard expansions to preserve personalized\nintent. 2) user corpora induce heterogeneous semantic structures-varying in\ntopical focus and lexical organization-which hinders the effective anchoring of\nexpanded queries within the user's corpora space. To address these challenges,\nwe propose Personalize Before Retrieve (PBR), a framework that incorporates\nuser-specific signals into query expansion prior to retrieval. PBR consists of\ntwo components: P-PRF, which generates stylistically aligned pseudo feedback\nusing user history for simulating user expression style, and P-Anchor, which\nperforms graph-based structure alignment over user corpora to capture its\nstructure. Together, they produce personalized query representations tailored\nfor retrieval. Experiments on two personalized benchmarks show that PBR\nconsistently outperforms strong baselines, with up to 10% gains on PersonaBench\nacross retrievers. Our findings demonstrate the value of modeling\npersonalization before retrieval to close the semantic gap in user-adaptive RAG\nsystems.

Companies\noften conduct risk investigations into suspicious cases to identify emerging\nfraud patterns, thereby enhancing both preemptive risk prevention and post-hoc\ngovernance. However, the sheer volume of case analyses imposes a substantial\nworkload on risk management analysts, as each case requires the integration of\nlong-term expert experience and meticulous scrutiny across multiple risk\ndimensions. Additionally, individual disparities among analysts hinder the\nestablishment of uniform and high-standard workflows. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the SHERLOCK framework, which leverages the reasoning\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs) to assist analysts in risk\ninvestigations. Our approach consists of three primary components: (1)\nextracting risk management knowledge from multi-modal data and constructing a\ndomain knowledge base (KB), (2) building an intelligent platform guided by the\ndata flywheel paradigm that integrates daily operations, expert annotations,\nand model evaluations, with iteratively fine-tuning for preference alignment,\nand (3) introducing a Reflect & Refine (R&R) module that collaborates with the\ndomain KB to establish a rapid response mechanism for evolving risk patterns.\nExperiments conducted on the real-world transaction dataset from JD.com\ndemonstrate that our method significantly improves the precision of both\nfactual alignment and risk localization within the LLM analysis results.\nDeployment of the SHERLOCK-based LLM system on JD.com has substantially\nenhanced the efficiency of case investigation workflows for risk managers."}

Recent studies--motivated by large reasoning models (LRMs)--have begun\nincorporating explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into LLM-based\nrerankers. However, the effectiveness of such reasoning for ranking tasks\nremains underexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study of\nreasoning in reranking across both pointwise and listwise settings, under both\nsupervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Using diverse benchmarks,\nincluding reasoning-intensive datasets (BRIGHT) and standard IR benchmarks\n(BEIR), we find that reasoning-augmented rerankers consistently underperform\ntheir direct counterparts that predict rankings without CoT, despite\nsubstantially higher inference costs. Our analysis reveals three core\nlimitations: (i) in pointwise rerankers, reasoning breaks calibration and\nbiases models toward the positive class, raising TPR but lowering TNR, which\ninflates false positives and degrades ranking in negative-dominant pools; (ii)\nin listwise rerankers, reasoning improves in-domain fit but increases variance\nand fails to generalize out-of-domain, even when reinforcement learning\nshortens rationales; and (iii) overall, directly fine-tuned rerankers remain\nmore stable, effective, and robust. These findings challenge the assumption\nthat explicit reasoning is universally beneficial for reranking. We conclude by\nhighlighting future directions, including calibration-aware scoring for\npointwise rerankers and the design of concise, targeted reasoning strategies to\nmitigate overfitting and overthinking in listwise rerankers."}

In this industry paper, we\nevaluate the effectiveness of controlled personalization through an A/B test\nconducted on the website of a major Norwegian legacy news organization.

While\nmost existing approaches optimize for short-term engagement, recent work has\nbegun to explore reinforcement learning (RL) to model long-term user value.\nHowever, these efforts face significant challenges due to the vast, dynamic\naction spaces inherent in recommendation, which hinder stable policy learning.\nTo resolve this bottleneck, we introduce Hierarchical Semantic RL (HSRL), which\nreframes RL-based recommendation over a fixed Semantic Action Space (SAS). HSRL\nencodes items as Semantic IDs (SIDs) for policy learning, and maps SIDs back to\ntheir original items via a fixed, invertible lookup during execution. To align\ndecision-making with SID generation, the Hierarchical Policy Network (HPN)\noperates in a coarse-to-fine manner, employing hierarchical residual state\nmodeling to refine each level's context from the previous level's residual,\nthereby stabilizing training and reducing representation-decision mismatch. In\nparallel, a Multi-level Critic (MLC) provides token-level value estimates,\nenabling fine-grained credit assignment. Across public benchmarks and a\nlarge-scale production dataset from a leading Chinese short-video advertising\nplatform, HSRL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. In online\ndeployment over a seven-day A/B testing, it delivers an 18.421% CVR lift with\nonly a 1.251% increase in cost, supporting HSRL as a scalable paradigm for\nRL-based recommendation.

MRMR contains 1,502 queries\nspanning 23 domains, with positive documents carefully verified by human\nexperts.

Second, queries are\nreasoning-intensive, with images requiring deeper interpretation such as\ndiagnosing microscopic slides. We further introduce Contradiction Retrieval, a\nnovel task requiring models to identify conflicting concepts. Finally, queries\nand documents are constructed as image-text interleaved sequences. Unlike\nearlier benchmarks restricted to single images or unimodal documents, MRMR\noffers a realistic setting with multi-image queries and mixed-modality corpus\ndocuments. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 4 categories of multimodal\nretrieval systems and 14 frontier models on MRMR. The text embedding model\nQwen3-Embedding with LLM-generated image captions achieves the highest\nperformance, highlighting substantial room for improving multimodal retrieval\nmodels.
