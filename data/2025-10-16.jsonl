However,\nthese systems face challenges, particularly in offline settings, where data\ninefficiency and reliance on pre-collected trajectories limit their broader\napplicability. While offline reinforcement learning methods leverage extensive\ndatasets to address these issues, they often struggle with noisy data and fail\nto capture long-term user preferences, resulting in suboptimal recommendation\npolicies. To overcome these limitations, we propose Diffusion-enhanced\nActor-Critic for Offline RL4RS (DAC4Rec), a novel framework that integrates\ndiffusion processes with reinforcement learning to model complex user\npreferences more effectively. DAC4Rec leverages the denoising capabilities of\ndiffusion models to enhance the robustness of offline RL algorithms and\nincorporates a Q-value-guided policy optimization strategy to better handle\nsuboptimal trajectories. Additionally, we introduce an energy-based sampling\nstrategy to reduce randomness during recommendation generation, ensuring more\ntargeted and reliable outcomes. We validate the effectiveness of DAC4Rec\nthrough extensive experiments on six real-world offline datasets and in an\nonline simulation environment, demonstrating its ability to optimize long-term\nuser preferences. Furthermore, we show that the proposed diffusion policy can\nbe seamlessly integrated into other commonly used RL algorithms in RL4RS,\nhighlighting its versatility and wide applicability."}

However, the training data often\nexhibits a long-tailed distribution, where only a few items have the majority\nof interactions. CF models trained directly on such imbalanced data are prone\nto learning popularity bias, which reduces personalization and leads to\nsuboptimal recommendation quality. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), while\neffective for CF due to their message passing mechanism, can further propagate\nand amplify popularity bias through their aggregation process. Existing\napproaches typically address popularity bias by modifying training objectives\nbut fail to directly counteract the bias propagated during GNN's neighborhood\naggregation. Applying weights to interactions during aggregation can help\nalleviate this problem, yet it risks distorting model learning due to unstable\nnode representations in the early stages of training. In this paper, we propose\na Post-hoc Popularity Debiasing (PPD) method that corrects for popularity bias\nin GNN-based CF and operates directly on pre-trained embeddings without\nrequiring retraining. By estimating interaction-level popularity and removing\npopularity components from node representations via a popularity direction\nvector, PPD reduces bias while preserving user preferences.

Prior works have focused on leveraging the\ngenerative capabilities of LLMs to improve GR, while overlooking that their\nreasoning capabilities could likewise help. This raises a key question: Can\nexplicit reasoning benefit GR? To investigate, we first conduct a preliminary\nstudy where an LLM is prompted to generate free-form chain-of-thought (CoT)\nreasoning before performing constrained docid decoding. Although this method\noutperforms standard GR, the generated reasoning tends to be verbose and poorly\naligned with the docid space. These limitations motivate the development of a\nreasoning mechanism better tailored to GR.\n  Therefore, we propose Reason-for-Retrieval (R4R), a reasoning-augmented\nframework for GR that converts free-form CoT reasoning into a compact,\nstructured format, and iteratively refines the reasoning during the retrieval\nprocess. R4R augments an existing GR method by leveraging a reasoning-capable\nLLM that has been instruction-tuned for GR. At inference time, R4R first uses\nthe LLM to generate an initial structured reasoning; then the same LLM\nalternates between (i) constrained decoding with the chosen GR method to\nproduce candidate docids and (ii) updating the reasoning based on retrieval\nresults to improve the next round. R4R does not require additional models or\ntraining, and instead a single LLM serves as both the reasoning generator and\nthe retriever. Extensive experiments on Natural Questions, MS MARCO, and a\nreal-world item-search benchmark validate the effectiveness of R4R."}

While LLM-based IR has shown great promise, the prevailing\nretrieve-then-rerank paradigm inherits the limitations of embedding-based\nretrieval; parametric generative approaches are difficult to update with new\ninformation; and long-context methods that place the entire corpus in context\nare computationally infeasible for large document collections. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce LATTICE, a hierarchical retrieval framework that\nenables an LLM to reason over and navigate large corpora with logarithmic\nsearch complexity by imposing a semantic tree structure on the corpus. Our\napproach consists of two stages: (1) an offline phase that organizes the corpus\ninto a semantic hierarchy via either a bottom-up agglomerative strategy or a\ntop-down divisive strategy using multi-level summaries and (2) an online\ntraversal phase where a search LLM navigates this tree. A central challenge in\nsuch LLM-guided search is that the model's relevance judgments are noisy,\ncontext-dependent, and unaware of the hierarchy, making cross-branch and\ncross-level comparisons difficult. To overcome this, we propose a traversal\nalgorithm that estimates calibrated latent relevance scores from local LLM\noutputs and aggregates them into a global path relevance metric.

Second, most RAG\nevaluations assume a static corpus, leaving a blind spot regarding update costs\nand retrieval stability as knowledge evolves. To make RAG time-aware, we\npropose Temporal GraphRAG (TG-RAG), which models external corpora as a bi-level\ntemporal graph consisting of a temporal knowledge graph with timestamped\nrelations and a hierarchical time graph. Multi-granularity temporal summaries\nare generated for each time node to capture both key events and broader trends\nat that time. The design supports incremental updates by extracting new\ntemporal facts from the incoming corpus and merging them into the existing\ngraph.
