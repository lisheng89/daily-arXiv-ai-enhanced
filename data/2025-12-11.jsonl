Lattice addresses these challenges through a comprehensive model space redesign that combines cross-domain knowledge sharing, data consolidation, model unification, distillation, and system optimizations to achieve significant improvements in both quality and cost-efficiency.\n  Our deployment of Lattice at Meta has resulted in 10% revenue-driving top-line metrics gain, 11.5% user satisfaction improvement, 6% boost in conversion rate, with 20% capacity saving."}
