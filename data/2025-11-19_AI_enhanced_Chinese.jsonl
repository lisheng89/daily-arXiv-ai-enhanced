Despite the rapid advancement of LLMs gradually replacing traditional BERT architectures for embedding, their training paradigms still adhere to BERT-like supervised fine-tuning and hard negative mining strategies. This approach relies on complex offline hard negative sample construction pipelines, which constrain model iteration efficiency and hinder the evolutionary potential of semantic representation capabilities. Besides, existing multi-task learning frameworks face the seesaw effect when simultaneously optimizing semantic relevance and non-relevance objectives. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-GRPO, a multi-objective reinforcement learning-based dense retrieval framework designed to address these challenges. The method eliminates offline hard negative sample construction by dynamically retrieving Top-K candidate products for each query during training, while introducing a relevance LLM as a reward model to generate real-time feedback. Specifically, the retrieval model dynamically optimizes embedding representations through reinforcement learning, with reward signals combining LLM-generated relevance scores, product quality scores, and multi-way exclusivity metrics to achieve multi-objective user preference alignment and real-time error correction. This mechanism not only removes dependency on hard negatives but also mitigates the seesaw effect through collaborative multi-objective optimization, significantly enhancing the model's semantic generalization capability for complex long-tail queries.

However, naive RAG methods struggle with multi-hop question answering due to their limited capacity to capture complex dependencies across documents. Recent studies employ graph-based RAG to capture document connections. However, these approaches often result in a loss of semantic coherence and introduce irrelevant noise during node matching and subgraph construction. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroPath, an LLM-driven semantic path tracking RAG framework inspired by the path navigational planning of place cells in neurobiology. It consists of two steps: Dynamic Path Tracking and Post-retrieval Completion. Dynamic Path Tracking performs goal-directed semantic path tracking and pruning over the constructed knowledge graph (KG), improving noise reduction and semantic coherence. Post-retrieval Completion further reinforces these benefits by conducting second-stage retrieval using intermediate reasoning and the original query to refine the query goal and complete missing information in the reasoning path. NeuroPath surpasses current state-of-the-art baselines on three multi-hop QA datasets, achieving average improvements of 16.3% on recall@2 and 13.5% on recall@5 over advanced graph-based RAG methods. Moreover, compared to existing iter-based RAG methods, NeuroPath achieves higher accuracy and reduces token consumption by 22.8%. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of NeuroPath across four smaller LLMs (Llama3.1, GLM4, Mistral0.3, and Gemma3), and further validate its scalability across tasks of varying complexity.

Text-based methods typically encode item textual information via prompt design and generate discrete semantic IDs through item tokenization. However, in domain-specific tasks such as local-life services, simply injecting location information into prompts fails to capture fine-grained spatial characteristics and real-world distance awareness among items. To address this, we propose LGSID, an LLM-Aligned Geographic Item Tokenization Framework for Local-life Recommendation. This framework consists of two key components: (1) RL-based Geographic LLM Alignment, and (2) Hierarchical Geographic Item Tokenization. In the RL-based alignment module, we initially train a list-wise reward model to capture real-world spatial relationships among items. We then introduce a novel G-DPO algorithm that uses pre-trained reward model to inject generalized spatial knowledge and collaborative signals into LLMs while preserving their semantic understanding. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical geographic item tokenization strategy, where primary tokens are derived from discrete spatial and content attributes, and residual tokens are refined using the aligned LLM's geographic representation vectors. Extensive experiments on real-world Kuaishou industry datasets show that LGSID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art discriminative and generative recommendation models.

However, existing generative models typically confine the generative paradigm to the training phase, primarily for representation learning. During online inference, they revert to a standard discriminative paradigm, failing to leverage their powerful generative capabilities to further improve prediction accuracy. This fundamental asymmetry between the training and inference phases prevents the generative paradigm from realizing its full potential. To address this limitation, we propose the Symmetric Masked Generative Paradigm for CTR prediction (SGCTR), a novel framework that establishes symmetry between the training and inference phases. Specifically, after acquiring generative capabilities by learning feature dependencies during training, SGCTR applies the generative capabilities during online inference to iteratively redefine the features of input samples, which mitigates the impact of noisy features and enhances prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of SGCTR, demonstrating that applying the generative paradigm symmetrically across both training and inference significantly unlocks its power in CTR prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u79f0\u63a9\u7801\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0fSGCTR\uff0c\u5728CTR\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4ecd\u56de\u5f52\u5224\u522b\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6f5c\u529b", "method": "SGCTR\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u83b7\u5f97\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5e94\u7528\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u8fed\u4ee3\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u8f93\u5165\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u51cf\u8f7b\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u5f81\u5f71\u54cd", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86SGCTR\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u79f0\u5e94\u7528\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u91ca\u653e\u5176\u5728CTR\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u79f0\u5e94\u7528\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347CTR\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0cSGCTR\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u95ee\u9898"}}

Building on previous distillation-based recipes from the English Stella and Jasper models, we successfully extend this approach to a bilingual (English and Chinese) domain, further enhancing model performance through the incorporation of contrastive learning. A key innovation of our model is the introduction of a one-dimensional convolution-based token compression module. We dynamically adjust the compression rate during training, enabling the model to learn more robust and efficient compressed text representations. By combining knowledge distillation with token compression techniques, we achieve significant improvements in both embedding quality and inference efficiency. Our model performs with higher efficiency than a traditional 0.6B model while achieving performance comparable to that of an 8B model.
