### [1] [Inconsistent Affective Reaction: Sentiment of Perception and Opinion in Urban Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07359)
*Jingfei Huang,Han Tu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种新颖的方法来识别和解释城市环境中的情感不一致性，通过整合街景图像和社交媒体文本数据，分析北京二环内2016年和2022年的情感反应变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台的兴起改变了我们对城市环境的理解，产生了嵌入人类感知和意见中的情感反应细微变化，这对城市研究中现有的多维情感分析方法提出了挑战。

Method: 构建包含140,750张百度腾讯街景图像和984,024条微博文本的数据集，开发反应指数，整合物体检测和自然语言处理技术，使用回归分析、图像分割和词频分析来分类和分析情感反应。

Result: 感知情感反应趋势图显示正向情感分布更均匀，而意见情感反应趋势图显示更极端的变化。不匹配图显示人类感知和意见情感存在显著差异，情感反应变化与密集建筑和行人存在等要素有显著关系。

Conclusion: 不一致图展示了疫情前后的感知和意见情感，为环境管理和城市更新策略制定提供了潜在解释和方向。

Abstract: The ascension of social media platforms has transformed our understanding of
urban environments, giving rise to nuanced variations in sentiment reaction
embedded within human perception and opinion, and challenging existing
multidimensional sentiment analysis approaches in urban studies. This study
presents novel methodologies for identifying and elucidating sentiment
inconsistency, constructing a dataset encompassing 140,750 Baidu and Tencent
Street view images to measure perceptions, and 984,024 Weibo social media text
posts to measure opinions. A reaction index is developed, integrating object
detection and natural language processing techniques to classify sentiment in
Beijing Second Ring for 2016 and 2022. Classified sentiment reaction is
analysed and visualized using regression analysis, image segmentation, and word
frequency based on land-use distribution to discern underlying factors. The
perception affective reaction trend map reveals a shift toward more evenly
distributed positive sentiment, while the opinion affective reaction trend map
shows more extreme changes. Our mismatch map indicates significant disparities
between the sentiments of human perception and opinion of urban areas over the
years. Changes in sentiment reactions have significant relationships with
elements such as dense buildings and pedestrian presence. Our inconsistent maps
present perception and opinion sentiments before and after the pandemic and
offer potential explanations and directions for environmental management, in
formulating strategies for urban renewal.

### [2] [Haystack Engineering: Context Engineering for Heterogeneous and Agentic Long-Context Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07414)
*Mufei Li,Dongqi Fu,Limei Wang,Si Zhang,Hanqing Zeng,Kaan Sancak,Ruizhong Qiu,Haoyu Wang,Xiaoxin He,Xavier Bresson,Yinglong Xia,Chonglin Sun,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了HaystackCraft基准测试，用于评估长上下文LLM在真实噪声环境下的鲁棒性，重点关注检索偏差和智能体工作流中的级联错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的"大海捞针"基准测试过于理想化，忽略了真实场景中由有偏检索和智能体工作流产生的噪声上下文，需要构建更真实的测试环境。

Method: 基于英文维基百科超链接网络构建HaystackCraft基准，包含多跳问题，评估不同检索策略对干扰项构成和LLM性能的影响，并扩展到动态智能体操作场景。

Result: 实验表明：更强的密集检索器会引入更具挑战性的干扰项，而基于图的重新排序能同时提高检索效果并减轻有害干扰；在智能体测试中，即使是先进模型也会因自生成干扰项而出现级联失败。

Conclusion: HaystackCraft揭示了智能体长上下文推理中的持续挑战，为未来研究提供了有价值的测试平台。

Abstract: Modern long-context large language models (LLMs) perform well on synthetic
"needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) benchmarks, but such tests overlook how noisy
contexts arise from biased retrieval and agentic workflows. We argue that
haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that
faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous
biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models'
long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH
benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop
questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies
(e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition,
haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further
extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic
operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and
decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1)
while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors,
graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and
mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 suffer cascading failures from self-generated
distractors or struggle to perform early stops. These results highlight
persistent challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and establish
HaystackCraft as a valuable testbed for future progress.

### [3] [Lemma Dilemma: On Lemma Generation Without Domain- or Language-Specific Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07434)
*Olia Toporkov,Alan Akbik,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文实证研究了大语言模型在上下文词形还原任务中的表现，与传统监督方法进行比较，发现LLMs在多数语言中无需微调即可达到最佳结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在多种NLP任务中表现出色，但在上下文词形还原任务中的有效性尚未得到验证，特别是在目标领域或语言缺乏监督训练数据的情况下。

Method: 比较了两种方法：(i)在域外微调的仅编码器监督方法，(ii)跨语言方法，与LLMs直接进行上下文词形生成。在12种不同形态复杂度的语言上进行实验。

Result: 研究发现，虽然编码器在域外设置下使用黄金数据微调仍具竞争力，但当前LLMs在多数语言中无需先验微调，仅需少量示例即可通过直接生成词形达到最先进结果。

Conclusion: LLMs在上下文词形还原任务中表现出色，特别是在缺乏监督数据的情况下，能够通过少量示例实现高性能。

Abstract: Lemmatization is the task of transforming all words in a given text to their
dictionary forms. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
ability to achieve competitive results across a wide range of NLP tasks, there
is no prior evidence of how effective they are in the contextual lemmatization
task. In this paper, we empirically investigate the capacity of the latest
generation of LLMs to perform in-context lemmatization, comparing it to the
traditional fully supervised approach. In particular, we consider the setting
in which supervised training data is not available for a target domain or
language, comparing (i) encoder-only supervised approaches, fine-tuned
out-of-domain, and (ii) cross-lingual methods, against direct in-context lemma
generation with LLMs. Our experimental investigation across 12 languages of
different morphological complexity finds that, while encoders remain
competitive in out-of-domain settings when fine-tuned on gold data, current
LLMs reach state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating
lemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, provided just with a few examples.

### [4] [LASER: An LLM-based ASR Scoring and Evaluation Rubric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07437)
*Amruta Parulekar,Preethi Jyothi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LASER评分标准，利用LLM的上下文学习能力评估ASR系统，解决传统WER指标对形态和句法细微差异的不公平惩罚问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR评估指标如WER对不影响句子语义的形态和句法细微差异惩罚过重，需要更公平的评估方法。

Method: 使用Gemini 2.5 Pro等LLM的上下文学习能力，通过包含详细示例的提示词进行评分；同时展示如何微调较小LLM来预测惩罚类型。

Result: Hindi LASER评分与人工标注的相关性达到94%；在马拉地语、卡纳达语和马拉雅拉姆语等其他印度语言中也有效；微调后的小型LLM预测惩罚类型准确率接近89%。

Conclusion: LLM-based LASER评分标准能有效评估ASR系统，在不同印度语言中表现良好，且小型LLM经过微调也能达到不错的性能。

Abstract: Standard ASR evaluation metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) tend to unfairly
penalize morphological and syntactic nuances that do not significantly alter
sentence semantics. We introduce an LLM-based scoring rubric LASER that
leverages state-of-the-art LLMs' in-context learning abilities to learn from
prompts with detailed examples. Hindi LASER scores using Gemini 2.5 Pro
achieved a very high correlation score of 94% with human annotations. Hindi
examples in the prompt were also effective in analyzing errors in other Indian
languages such as Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam. We also demonstrate how a
smaller LLM like Llama 3 can be finetuned on word-pair examples derived from
reference and ASR predictions to predict what kind of penalty should be applied
with close to 89% accuracy.

### [5] [Meaningful Pose-Based Sign Language Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07453)
*Zifan Jiang,Colin Leong,Amit Moryossef,Anne Göhring,Annette Rios,Oliver Cory,Maksym Ivashechkin,Neha Tarigopula,Biao Zhang,Rico Sennrich,Sarah Ebling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个系统性的手语姿势评估研究，涵盖基于关键点距离、嵌入和回译的评估指标，并通过自动元评估和人工相关性研究展示了不同场景下各指标的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要对手语姿势进行有意义的评估，为手语翻译或生成系统的开发和评估提供实用且可复现的方法。

Method: 研究基于关键点距离、嵌入和回译的评估指标，通过自动元评估（手语级别检索）和人工相关性研究（跨语言文本到姿势翻译）来评估不同指标。

Result: 展示了不同场景下各评估指标的权衡关系，并开发了开源姿势评估工具包。

Conclusion: 该研究为手语翻译或生成系统的开发和评估提供了实用且可复现的方法和工具。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on meaningfully evaluating sign language
utterances in the form of human skeletal poses. The study covers keypoint
distance-based, embedding-based, and back-translation-based metrics. We show
tradeoffs between different metrics in different scenarios through automatic
meta-evaluation of sign-level retrieval and a human correlation study of
text-to-pose translation across different sign languages. Our findings and the
open-source pose-evaluation toolkit provide a practical and reproducible way of
developing and evaluating sign language translation or generation systems.

### [6] [Populism Meets AI: Advancing Populism Research with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07458)
*Eduardo Ryô Tamaki,Yujin J. Jung,Julia Chatterley,Grant Mitchell,Semir Dzebo,Cristóbal Sandoval,Levente Littvay,Kirk A. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于规则和锚点引导的思维链提示方法，用于测量民粹主义的思想内容，该方法通过模仿人类编码员训练过程，使大语言模型能够达到与专家人类编码员相当的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于文本分析的民粹主义测量方法成本高、耗时长，难以跨语言、跨语境和大规模语料库扩展，需要开发更高效、可扩展的测量方法。

Method: 使用全球民粹主义数据库(GPD)作为训练数据，通过规则和锚点引导的思维链提示方法，模仿人类编码员训练过程，让LLM学习民粹主义的分类标准。

Result: 该方法使LLM在民粹主义分类任务上达到了与专家人类编码员相当的准确率，能够处理民粹主义的细微和语境敏感特征。

Conclusion: 基于规则和锚点引导的思维链提示方法为测量民粹主义思想内容提供了一种有效、可扩展的替代方案，展示了LLM在复杂政治概念分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Measuring the ideational content of populism remains a challenge. Traditional
strategies based on textual analysis have been critical for building the
field's foundations and providing a valid, objective indicator of populist
framing. Yet these approaches are costly, time consuming, and difficult to
scale across languages, contexts, and large corpora. Here we present the
results from a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought (CoT) prompting
approach that mirrors human coder training. By leveraging the Global Populism
Database (GPD), a comprehensive dataset of global leaders' speeches annotated
for degrees of populism, we replicate the process used to train human coders by
prompting the LLM with an adapted version of the same documentation to guide
the model's reasoning. We then test multiple proprietary and open weight models
by replicating scores in the GPD. Our findings reveal that this domain specific
prompting strategy enables the LLM to achieve classification accuracy on par
with expert human coders, demonstrating its ability to navigate the nuanced,
context sensitive aspects of populism.

### [7] [MAPRO: Recasting Multi-Agent Prompt Optimization as Maximum a Posteriori Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07475)
*Zheyuan Zhang,Lin Ge,Hongjiang Li,Weicheng Zhu,Chuxu Zhang,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAPRO是一个多智能体提示优化框架，通过将多智能体系统提示优化建模为最大后验推理问题，使用语言引导的置信传播算法和拓扑感知优化机制，实现自动化的多智能体提示优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统虽然能超越单智能体性能，但由于提示敏感性和系统不稳定性，设计有效的多智能体系统仍然困难。现有的自动提示设计方法主要针对单智能体，多智能体提示优化仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出四阶段MAPRO框架：1) 将多智能体提示优化建模为最大后验推理问题；2) 使用语言引导的max-product置信传播算法求解；3) 采用拓扑感知优化机制，结合执行反馈和下游责任分配；4) 迭代更新智能体提示，逐步收敛到协调的提示策略集。

Result: 在多个任务的基准测试中，MAPRO实现了最先进的性能，持续超越手动设计的基线和最近的自动化替代方案。

Conclusion: MAPRO不仅提升了多智能体系统的性能，其基于最大后验的公式化为构建更可靠和原则化的多智能体系统提供了通用指导原则。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, and LLM-based agents further extend these abilities to various
practical workflows. While recent progress shows that multi-agent systems (MAS)
can outperform single agents by coordinating specialized roles, designing
effective MAS remains difficult due to prompt sensitivity and the compounded
instability MAS creates. To cope with the challenge, recent efforts in
automated prompt design have reduced manual effort. However, multi-agent prompt
optimization remains largely unexplored. Challenges like exponentially
expanding search space and ambiguous credit assignment together make systematic
design intractable without principled methods. Therefore, we introduce
M}ulti-Agent PRompt Optimization (MAPRO), a four-stage framework that first
formulates MAS prompt optimization as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference
problem and solves it using a language-guided variant of max-product belief
propagation algorithm. To address credit assignment and updates the system
iteratively, MAPRO employs a topology-aware refinement mechanism that
integrates execution feedback and downstream blames to selectively update agent
prompts. Through this process, MAPRO progressively converges to a coordinated
set of agent-specific prompt policies. Across benchmarks in various tasks,
MAPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpassing manually
engineered baselines and recent automated alternatives. Beyond performance, our
MAP-based formulation also delivers general guidelines for building more
reliable and principled multi-agent systems in the future

### [8] [AsyncSpade: Efficient Test-Time Scaling with Asynchronous Sparse Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07486)
*Shuqing Luo,Yilin Guan,Pingzhi Li,Hanrui Wang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AsyncSpade是一个异步框架，通过预测查询状态和解耦KV缓存过滤，在测试时缩放任务中显著减少推理时间，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放通过长思维链提升LLM推理能力，但线性KV缓存增长加剧了内存瓶颈。现有查询感知稀疏解码方法受限于顺序依赖和粗粒度标记选择，在高并发和长思维链场景下效率低下。

Method: 提出AsyncSpade框架，包含：(1)轻量级时序回归模块预测下一标记查询状态；(2)异步解耦框架将KV缓存过滤与自回归解码循环分离，通过异步机制重叠KV选择与前向推理计算。

Result: 在A100节点上，AsyncSpade完全重叠KV缓存操作与推理流水线，实现理论最优TPOT。相比SoTA基线Quest减少20%以上TPOT，相比全注意力减少至少50%TPOT，在Qwen3-8B和Qwen3-32B模型上保持或超越各种TTS基准的准确率。

Conclusion: AsyncSpade首次在不牺牲模型性能的情况下消除了顺序依赖，为高效测试时缩放提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) boosts LLM reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT),
but the linear KV-cache growth amplifies the memory-bound bottleneck of LLM
decoding. Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art
performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both
sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection,
hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high
concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the
forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step
query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short
window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without
waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework
for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight
temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an
asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering
from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV
selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our
knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence
without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of
AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade
fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving
theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade
delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and
at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and
Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS
benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).

### [9] [Can Lessons From Human Teams Be Applied to Multi-Agent Systems? The Role of Structure, Diversity, and Interaction Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07488)
*Rasika Muralidharan,Jaewoon Kwak,Jisun An*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个多智能体框架来探索团队科学的核心方面：结构、多样性和互动动态，评估了在常识推理和社交推理任务上的团队表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受到人类团队科学的启发，探索大型语言模型驱动的多智能体系统中的团队动态，这是当前研究中较少关注的领域。

Method: 提出了一个多智能体框架，通过四个任务（CommonsenseQA、StrategyQA、Social IQa和Latent Implicit Hate）来评估团队结构、多样性和互动动态对性能的影响。

Result: 扁平化团队比层级化团队表现更好，多样性影响较为复杂。智能体对团队表现过度自信，但任务后反思显示它们欣赏协作，同时面临整合挑战和有限的对话协调。

Conclusion: 多智能体团队在协作中表现出积极态度，但在协调和整合方面存在挑战，扁平化结构通常更有效。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents are
gaining attention, yet fewer studies explore their team dynamics. Inspired by
human team science, we propose a multi-agent framework to examine core aspects
of team science: structure, diversity, and interaction dynamics. We evaluate
team performance across four tasks: CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA, Social IQa, and
Latent Implicit Hate, spanning commonsense and social reasoning. Our results
show that flat teams tend to perform better than hierarchical ones, while
diversity has a nuanced impact. Interviews suggest agents are overconfident
about their team performance, yet post-task reflections reveal both
appreciation for collaboration and challenges in integration, including limited
conversational coordination.

### [10] [Can Speech LLMs Think while Listening?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07497)
*Yi-Jen Shih,Desh Raj,Chunyang Wu,Wei Zhou,SK Bong,Yashesh Gaur,Jay Mahadeokar,Ozlem Kalinli,Mike Seltzer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled
seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex
reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning
has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of
text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for
multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves
the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken
reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a
crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human
behavior of "thinking while listening," we propose methods to reduce the
additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning
before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based
metric, "question completeness," which acts as an indicator to guide the model
on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control
over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches
and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on
ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference
data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto
frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in
accuracy.

### [11] [When Thoughts Meet Facts: Reusable Reasoning for Long-Context LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07499)
*Soyeong Jeong,Taehee Jung,Sung Ju Hwang,Joo-Kyung Kim,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL)框架，通过可复用的思维模板来指导长上下文语言模型的多跳推理，解决了简单增加文档数量无法有效连接证据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长上下文语言模型虽然能处理大量token，但仅仅将更多文档输入上下文窗口无法有效捕捉证据之间的连接关系，限制了知识密集型多跳推理的能力。

Method: 使用思维模板将推理重构为可复用的思维缓存，这些模板来自先前的解题轨迹，用于结构化证据组合并指导多跳推理。通过基于自然语言反馈的迭代更新策略来保持模板有效性。

Result: 在多样化基准测试和不同LCLM家族中，该方法相比强基线在基于检索和无检索设置下都取得了持续提升。优化后的模板还可以蒸馏到更小的开源模型中。

Conclusion: ToTAL框架通过思维模板增强了长上下文语言模型的多跳推理能力，展示了广泛的适用性和透明的推理复用性。

Abstract: Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can process hundreds of thousands
of tokens in a single prompt, enabling new opportunities for
knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning by integrating large sets of retrieved
documents or, in some cases, directly all necessary information. However,
simply feeding more documents into the context window fails to capture how
evidence should be connected. We address this gap with thought templates, which
recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving
traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference
with factual documents. To keep these templates effective, we propose an update
strategy that iteratively refines templates derived from training data through
natural-language feedback. Across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families, our
approach delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both
retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Furthermore, we show that
optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models,
demonstrating its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse. We refer
to our framework as Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL).

### [12] [ParsTranslit: Truly Versatile Tajik-Farsi Transliteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07520)
*Rayyan Merchant,Kevin Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的波斯语-塔吉克语双向音译模型，该模型在现有所有数据集上训练，并在多个领域实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波斯语使用两种书写标准（波斯-阿拉伯文和塔吉克-西里尔文），虽然方言相似但文字差异阻碍了塔吉克斯坦与其他波斯语国家的书面交流。现有音译模型局限于特定领域文本，缺乏实际应用的通用性。

Method: 使用序列到序列模型，在所有可用数据集上进行训练，并提供了两个新的数据集。

Result: 模型在Farsi到Tajik方向获得chrF++ 87.91和标准化CER 0.05，在Tajik到Farsi方向获得chrF++ 92.28和标准化CER 0.04。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了跨领域的音译性能基准，模型、数据和代码已公开，为波斯语书写系统间的交流提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: As a digraphic language, the Persian language utilizes two written standards:
Perso-Arabic in Afghanistan and Iran, and Tajik-Cyrillic in Tajikistan. Despite
the significant similarity between the dialects of each country, script
differences prevent simple one-to-one mapping, hindering written communication
and interaction between Tajikistan and its Persian-speaking ``siblings''. To
overcome this, previously-published efforts have investigated machine
transliteration models to convert between the two scripts. Unfortunately, most
efforts did not use datasets other than those they created, limiting these
models to certain domains of text such as archaic poetry or word lists. A truly
usable transliteration system must be capable of handling varied domains,
meaning that suck models lack the versatility required for real-world usage.
The contrast in domain between data also obscures the task's true difficulty.
We present a new state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model for Tajik-Farsi
transliteration trained across all available datasets, and present two datasets
of our own. Our results across domains provide clearer understanding of the
task, and set comprehensive comparable leading benchmarks. Overall, our model
achieves chrF++ and Normalized CER scores of 87.91 and 0.05 from Farsi to Tajik
and 92.28 and 0.04 from Tajik to Farsi. Our model, data, and code are available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ParsTranslit-FB30/.

### [13] [OWL: Overcoming Window Length-Dependence in Speculative Decoding for Long-Context Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07535)
*Jaeseong Lee,seung-won hwang,Aurick Qiao,Gabriele Oliaro,Ye Wang,Samyam Rajbhandari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为OWL的新型推测解码方法，通过LSTM-based drafter、特殊token [SPEC]和混合解码算法，在长上下文场景下实现了比EAGLE3高5倍的接受长度，解决了现有推测解码方法在长上下文中的性能退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法在短上下文（如2K tokens）基准上表现良好，但在实际长上下文工作负载中性能严重下降，甚至出现速度倒退（如EAGLE3降低0.81倍生成速度），需要开发能够适应长上下文场景的推测解码方法。

Method: 1) 基于LSTM的drafter，仅依赖于最后一个token状态，使其能够泛化到各种长度；2) 在验证器中引入特殊token [SPEC]，为drafter生成更丰富的表示；3) 结合树形和非树形解码方法的混合算法。

Result: 在长上下文输入上，OWL实现了比EAGLE3高约5倍的接受长度，显著提升了长上下文场景下的生成速度。

Conclusion: OWL通过创新的drafter设计、特殊token机制和混合解码策略，有效解决了推测解码在长上下文中的性能问题，为未来研究提供了新的基准和工具。

Abstract: Speculative decoding promises faster inference for large language models
(LLMs), yet existing methods fail to generalize to real-world settings.
Benchmarks typically assume short contexts (e.g., 2K tokens), whereas practical
workloads involve long contexts. We find current approaches degrade severely
with long contexts; for instance, EAGLE3 even slows down the generation speed
by 0.81x. We address these limitations by releasing a new long-context
benchmark (LongSpecBench) and introducing a novel model (OWL). OWL achieves
about 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs through
three innovations: (1) an LSTM-based drafter conditioned only on the last-token
state, making it generalize to various lengths, (2) a special token [SPEC] in
the verifier that produces richer representation for drafter, and (3) a hybrid
algorithm combining both tree and non-tree decoding methods. We release all
code and datasets to advance future research.

### [14] [Deploying Tiny LVLM Judges for Real-World Evaluation of Chart Models: Lessons Learned and Best Practices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07545)
*Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar,Mohammed Saidul Islam,Ridwan Mahbub,Mizanur Rahman,Amran Bhuiyan,Israt Jahan,Mir Tafseer Nayeem,Shafiq Joty,Enamul Hoque,Jimmy Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了两种方法提升小型视觉语言模型在图表理解任务中的评估能力：多标准提示和领域自适应迁移学习，创建了ChartJudge模型，在资源受限环境下实现高效评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在图表理解任务中表现良好，但小型模型（≤2B参数）作为评估者表现不佳，限制了在资源受限环境中的实际应用。

Method: 1. 多标准提示：将多个评估标准合并到单个查询中；2. 领域自适应迁移学习：在图表数据集上对2B参数LVLM进行微调，使用合成判断数据创建ChartJudge模型。

Result: 多标准提示暴露了7B模型的鲁棒性差距，导致性能大幅下降；ChartJudge能够有效在不同数据集间迁移知识，成为更专业的模型。

Conclusion: 通过模型大小、提示设计和可迁移性之间的权衡分析，为图表推理任务提供了可扩展、低成本的评估解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with only 7B parameters have shown
promise as automated judges in chart comprehension tasks. However, tiny models
(<=2B parameters) still perform poorly as judges, limiting their real-world use
in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose two approaches to
ensure cost-efficient evaluation: (i) multi-criteria prompting, which combines
separate evaluation criteria into a single query, and (ii) domain-adaptive
transfer learning, in which we fine-tune a 2B-parameter LVLM on synthetic
judgments in a chart dataset to create the ChartJudge. Experiments show that
multi-criteria prompting exposes robustness gaps, which led to a huge drop in
performance for 7B models, including specialized LVLM judges like LLaVA-Critic.
In addition, we find that our tiny LVLM (ChartJudge) can effectively transfer
knowledge from one dataset to another to make it a more specialized model. Our
fine-grained analysis across chart types and query complexities offers
actionable insights into trade-offs between model size, prompt design, and
transferability, enabling scalable, low-cost evaluation for chart reasoning
tasks. Our code and the data will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出基于任务特定LoRA模块的多任务预微调框架，解决轻量级BERT编码器在移动端NLP任务中的适应性问题，在21个下游任务上实现NER任务平均提升0.8%，文本分类任务平均提升8.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在移动平台上部署NLP模型需要模型能够适应多样化应用，同时保持内存和计算效率。研究预微调策略以增强轻量级BERT编码器在命名实体识别和文本分类两个基础NLP任务家族中的适应性。

Method: 提出基于任务特定LoRA模块的多任务预微调框架，使用单一共享编码器骨干网络和模块化适配器，避免多任务预微调中的优化信号冲突问题。

Result: 在21个下游任务上的实验显示，命名实体识别任务平均提升0.8%，文本分类任务平均提升8.8%，性能与单独预微调相当，同时满足实际部署约束。

Conclusion: 该方法为多功能移动NLP应用提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，能够在保持部署效率的同时提升模型适应性。

Abstract: Deploying natural language processing (NLP) models on mobile platforms
requires models that can adapt across diverse applications while remaining
efficient in memory and computation. We investigate pre-finetuning strategies
to enhance the adaptability of lightweight BERT-like encoders for two
fundamental NLP task families: named entity recognition (NER) and text
classification. While pre-finetuning improves downstream performance for each
task family individually, we find that na\"ive multi-task pre-finetuning
introduces conflicting optimization signals that degrade overall performance.
To address this, we propose a simple yet effective multi-task pre-finetuning
framework based on task-primary LoRA modules, which enables a single shared
encoder backbone with modular adapters. Our approach achieves performance
comparable to individual pre-finetuning while meeting practical deployment
constraint. Experiments on 21 downstream tasks show average improvements of
+0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our method for versatile mobile NLP applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过计算语言学分析疫情相关网络话语，发现健康错误信息在可读性、修辞标记和说服性语言使用上与事实性内容存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在识别健康错误信息的语言特征，以帮助检测错误信息并改进公共卫生传播策略。

Method: 使用三个语料库（COVID-19错误叙事、一般COVID-19内容和猴痘相关帖子）进行对比分析，考察可读性、修辞标记和说服性语言的使用差异。

Result: COVID-19错误信息可读性显著较低，恐惧相关或说服性词汇频率是其他数据集的两倍以上，感叹号使用最少，表明其采用复杂修辞风格嵌入情感线索。

Conclusion: 错误信息采用故意复杂的修辞风格结合情感线索，可能增强其可信度感知。研究为数字健康错误信息检测提供了语言指标，但也存在使用传统可读性指数和静态分析等局限性。

Abstract: This study conducts a computational linguistic analysis of pandemic-related
online discourse to examine how language distinguishes health misinformation
from factual communication. Drawing on three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives
(n = 7588), general COVID-19 content (n = 10700), and Monkeypox-related posts
(n = 5787), we identify significant differences in readability, rhetorical
markers, and persuasive language use. COVID-19 misinformation exhibited
markedly lower readability scores and contained over twice the frequency of
fear-related or persuasive terms compared to the other datasets. It also showed
minimal use of exclamation marks, contrasting with the more emotive style of
Monkeypox content. These patterns suggest that misinformation employs a
deliberately complex rhetorical style embedded with emotional cues, a
combination that may enhance its perceived credibility. Our findings contribute
to the growing body of work on digital health misinformation by highlighting
linguistic indicators that may aid detection efforts. They also inform public
health messaging strategies and theoretical models of crisis communication in
networked media environments. At the same time, the study acknowledges
limitations, including reliance on traditional readability indices, use of a
deliberately narrow persuasive lexicon, and reliance on static aggregate
analysis. Future research should therefore incorporate longitudinal designs,
broader emotion lexicons, and platform-sensitive approaches to strengthen
robustness.

TL;DR: 使用LLMs作为工具开发人造语言的模块化系统，包括音系学创建、句子翻译、词典构建、正字法设计和语法手册编写


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一是为创建人造语言提供有趣工具，二是探索LLMs对语言和语言学概念的理解程度

Method: 模块化方法：先通过代理方法创建目标音系学，然后将英语句子翻译成反映目标语言词序和形态句法特征的标记，构建词典，设计正字法，最后编写语法手册

Result: 不同LLMs能力和不同语言规范之间存在较大差距，处理常见模式比罕见模式更容易；在从高资源语言翻译到低资源语言的应用中结果大多为负面

Conclusion: 当前系统在处理常见语言模式方面表现良好，但在处理罕见模式和高低资源语言翻译方面仍有局限，改进版本可能在这些任务中取得真正进展

Abstract: We present a system that uses LLMs as a tool in the development of
Constructed Languages. The system is modular in that one first creates a target
phonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at
each step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of
sentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic
markup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications
of the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic
feature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using
the phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted
from the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an
orthography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or
Cyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the
language. The system can also translate further sentences into the target
language.
  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for
creating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in
exploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any
particular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and
understand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly
wide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different
linguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal
with more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore
is the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into
low-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we
provide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could
afford some real gains in such tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了语言模型输入词汇表征的结构及其在训练过程中的演化，发现词汇嵌入几何快速收敛到与语义和句法特征高度相关，高频词和功能词比低频词收敛更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型的输入词汇表征如何结构化，以及这种结构在训练过程中如何演化，特别关注几何结构与语义、句法和频率特征的关系。

Method: 使用表征相似性分析，对Pythia 12B和OLMo 7B两个开源模型的输入和输出嵌入进行实验，关联其几何结构与语义、句法和频率指标在整个训练过程中的变化。

Result: 1) 词汇嵌入几何在训练中快速收敛到与语义和句法特征高度相关；2) 高频词和功能词比词汇词和低频词更快收敛到最终向量，后者保留了随机初始化的偏差。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了词汇几何围绕语言结构组织的动态轨迹，显示了词频和功能词的不同作用，为研究词汇几何演化如何促进模型能力提升提供了动机。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) work by manipulating the geometry of input
embedding vectors over multiple layers. Here, we ask: how are the input
vocabulary representations of language models structured, and how and when does
this structure evolve over training? To answer this question, we use
representational similarity analysis, running a suite of experiments that
correlate the geometric structure of the input embeddings and output embeddings
of two open-source models (Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B) with semantic, syntactic,
and frequency-based metrics over the course of training. Our key findings are
as follows: 1) During training, the vocabulary embedding geometry quickly
converges to high correlations with a suite of semantic and syntactic features;
2) Embeddings of high-frequency and function words (e.g., "the," "of") converge
to their final vectors faster than lexical and low-frequency words, which
retain some alignment with the bias in their random initializations. These
findings help map the dynamic trajectory by which input embeddings organize
around linguistic structure, revealing distinct roles for word frequency and
function. Our findings motivate a deeper study of how the evolution of
vocabulary geometry may facilitate specific capability gains during model
training.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了LLM在临床编码任务中的失败原因，发现层次性接近但错误的预测是主要问题，提出了轻量级干预方法和临床编码验证任务，并发布了专家标注的门诊临床笔记基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在临床编码任务中表现不佳，特别是基于精确匹配的评估方法无法识别层次性接近但错误的预测，这些错误占据了LLM失败的很大比例。

Method: 采用轻量级干预方法（包括提示工程和小规模微调），引入临床编码验证作为独立任务和流水线组件，并创建了专家双重标注的门诊临床笔记基准数据集。

Result: 验证被证明是提高基于LLM的医疗编码的有效且可靠步骤，轻量级干预方法在不增加计算开销的情况下提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 临床编码验证是改进LLM医疗编码性能的关键步骤，层次性错误分析为理解LLM失败提供了新视角，新发布的数据集有助于解决现有数据集的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate clinical coding is essential for healthcare documentation, billing,
and decision-making. While prior work shows that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle
with this task, evaluations based on exact match metrics often overlook errors
where predicted codes are hierarchically close but incorrect. Our analysis
reveals that such hierarchical misalignments account for a substantial portion
of LLM failures. We show that lightweight interventions, including prompt
engineering and small-scale fine-tuning, can improve accuracy without the
computational overhead of search-based methods. To address hierarchically
near-miss errors, we introduce clinical code verification as both a standalone
task and a pipeline component. To mitigate the limitations in existing
datasets, such as incomplete evidence and inpatient bias in MIMIC, we release
an expert double-annotated benchmark of outpatient clinical notes with ICD-10
codes. Our results highlight verification as an effective and reliable step
toward improving LLM-based medical coding.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了LLM在角色条件拒绝方面的能力，通过扩展Spider和BIRD数据集添加PostgreSQL角色策略，比较了三种方法：提示、两步验证管道和LoRA微调，发现显式验证能提高拒绝精度，微调在安全性和实用性间取得更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 访问控制是安全计算的基础，但大语言模型经常通过产生无限制响应来模糊角色边界，需要研究LLM遵守访问控制策略的能力。

Method: 创建了扩展Spider和BIRD数据集的新数据集，添加了表级和列级的PostgreSQL角色策略，比较了三种设计：零/少样本提示、两步生成器-验证器管道、LoRA微调模型。

Result: 在多个模型系列中，显式验证（两步框架）提高了拒绝精度并降低了错误许可，同时微调在安全性和实用性之间实现了更好的平衡。更长更复杂的策略持续降低所有系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: 显式验证能有效提高LLM的访问控制合规性，微调方法在安全性和实用性间达到最佳平衡，复杂策略会降低系统可靠性。

Abstract: Access control is a cornerstone of secure computing, yet large language
models often blur role boundaries by producing unrestricted responses. We study
role-conditioned refusals, focusing on the LLM's ability to adhere to access
control policies by answering when authorized and refusing when not. To
evaluate this behavior, we created a novel dataset that extends the Spider and
BIRD text-to-SQL datasets, both of which have been modified with realistic
PostgreSQL role-based policies at the table and column levels. We compare three
designs: (i) zero or few-shot prompting, (ii) a two-step generator-verifier
pipeline that checks SQL against policy, and (iii) LoRA fine-tuned models that
learn permission awareness directly. Across multiple model families, explicit
verification (the two-step framework) improves refusal precision and lowers
false permits. At the same time, fine-tuning achieves a stronger balance
between safety and utility (i.e., when considering execution accuracy). Longer
and more complex policies consistently reduce the reliability of all systems.
We release RBAC-augmented datasets and code.

Motivation: 传统银行界面采用僵化的多屏幕工作流程，而现有的AI助手仅限于咨询或支持角色。本文旨在开发一个能够作为主要银行界面、执行核心金融交易的对话AI系统。

Method: 基于内部开发的闭源LLM ILMU构建Ryt AI框架，使用四个LLM驱动的代理（护栏、意图、支付和FAQ），每个代理附加任务特定的LoRA适配器，在银行基础设施内托管以确保一致性。

Result: 成功实现了全球首个监管批准的自然语言银行界面，能够可靠支持核心金融操作，展示了在严格治理下对话AI的可行性。

Conclusion: Ryt AI证明了在严格监管环境下，自然语言界面可以可靠地支持核心金融操作，代表了银行服务交互方式的重大进步。

Abstract: This paper presents Ryt AI, an LLM-native agentic framework that powers Ryt
Bank to enable customers to execute core financial transactions through natural
language conversation. This represents the first global regulator-approved
deployment worldwide where conversational AI functions as the primary banking
interface, in contrast to prior assistants that have been limited to advisory
or support roles. Built entirely in-house, Ryt AI is powered by ILMU, a
closed-source LLM developed internally, and replaces rigid multi-screen
workflows with a single dialogue orchestrated by four LLM-powered agents
(Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ). Each agent attaches a task-specific
LoRA adapter to ILMU, which is hosted within the bank's infrastructure to
ensure consistent behavior with minimal overhead. Deterministic guardrails,
human-in-the-loop confirmation, and a stateless audit architecture provide
defense-in-depth for security and compliance. The result is Banking Done Right:
demonstrating that regulator-approved natural-language interfaces can reliably
support core financial operations under strict governance.

TL;DR: OBCache是一个基于最优脑损伤理论的KV缓存淘汰框架，将缓存淘汰建模为结构化剪枝问题，通过量化token对注意力输出的扰动来评估重要性，相比基于启发式注意力权重的现有方法能提升长上下文准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的长上下文窗口带来了显著的内存开销，现有缓存淘汰方法基于启发式注意力权重评估token重要性，但没有考虑其对注意力输出的真实影响。

Method: 基于OBD理论，将缓存淘汰建模为分层结构化剪枝问题，通过闭式解量化剪枝token对注意力输出的扰动，为孤立key、孤立value和联合key-value对计算重要性分数。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型上的实验表明，用OBCache的输出感知分数替换现有工作的启发式分数，能持续提升长上下文准确性。

Conclusion: OBCache提供了一个原则性的缓存淘汰框架，通过输出感知的重要性评估改进了现有方法，在保持性能的同时减少了内存开销。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows enable powerful
downstream applications but impose significant memory overhead, as caching all
key-value (KV) states scales linearly with sequence length and batch size.
Existing cache eviction methods address this by exploiting attention sparsity,
yet they typically rank tokens heuristically using accumulated attention
weights without considering their true impact on attention outputs. We propose
Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache
eviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal
Brain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the
perturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form
scores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs.
Our scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from
value states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction
strategies with output-aware signals. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models
demonstrate that replacing the heuristic scores in existing works, which
estimate token saliency across different query positions, with OBCache's
output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.

<details>

Motivation: 传统token概率偏见评估方法虽然应用广泛，但被批评与真实语言模型使用场景和危害存在距离，需要探索更现实的替代评估指标。

Method: 测试自然语言推理作为偏见评估的替代指标，比较NLI与TP方法在偏见检测上的表现差异和相关性。

Result: NLI和TP偏见评估行为差异很大，相关性很低；NLI方法更易检测"去偏见不足"的情况，但对反刻板印象句子的措辞更敏感脆弱。

Conclusion: token概率和自然语言推理都不是在所有情况下"更好"的偏见评估指标，建议结合TP、NLI和下游偏见评估来确保语言模型的全面评估。

Abstract: Measurement of social bias in language models is typically by token
probability (TP) metrics, which are broadly applicable but have been criticized
for their distance from real-world langugage model use cases and harms. In this
work, we test natural language inference (NLI) as a more realistic alternative
bias metric. We show that, curiously, NLI and TP bias evaluation behave
substantially differently, with very low correlation among different NLI
metrics and between NLI and TP metrics. We find that NLI metrics are more
likely to detect "underdebiased" cases. However, NLI metrics seem to be more
brittle and sensitive to wording of counterstereotypical sentences than TP
approaches. We conclude that neither token probability nor natural language
inference is a "better" bias metric in all cases, and we recommend a
combination of TP, NLI, and downstream bias evaluations to ensure comprehensive
evaluation of language models.

Motivation: 当前AI宪法和模型规范面临内部原则冲突和细微场景覆盖不足的关键挑战，需要系统化方法来识别和解决这些规范问题。

Method: 使用全面的分类法生成多样化的价值权衡场景，迫使模型在无法同时满足的合法原则对之间做出选择，通过价值分类分数测量行为分歧。

Result: 识别了超过70,000个表现出显著行为分歧的案例，高行为分歧强烈预测模型规范中的潜在问题，发现了直接矛盾和原则解释模糊等具体问题。

Conclusion: 该方法有效揭示了当前模型规范中的系统性缺陷，包括原则冲突、解释模糊、明显错位案例和误报拒绝，并提供了不同模型的价值优先级模式差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions
and model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical
principles. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including
internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced
scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model
character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle
contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.
  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force
explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a
comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where
models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be
simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs
across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral
disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we
identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence.
Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts
underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we
provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct
contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally,
our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and
false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we
also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming cellular biology by enabling
the development of "virtual cells"--computational systems that represent,
predict, and reason about cellular states and behaviors. This work provides a
comprehensive review of LLMs for virtual cell modeling. We propose a unified
taxonomy that organizes existing methods into two paradigms: LLMs as Oracles,
for direct cellular modeling, and LLMs as Agents, for orchestrating complex
scientific tasks. We identify three core tasks--cellular representation,
perturbation prediction, and gene regulation inference--and review their
associated models, datasets, evaluation benchmarks, as well as the critical
challenges in scalability, generalizability, and interpretability.

Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测模型主要依赖表面语言线索，难以有效泛化到不同风格变化。不同平台的仇恨言论针对不同群体并采用独特风格，可能引发虚假相关性。

Result: CADET在综合实验中表现出优越性能，突显了因果先验在推进可泛化仇恨言论检测方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 因果表示学习框架CADET能够有效分离仇恨意图与表面语言线索，提高仇恨言论检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the
harmony of the web. While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt
slurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony,
stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate
speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic
cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations.
Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct
groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations
between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.
Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate
speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual
environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we
propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles
hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders,
thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues.
Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style
within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate
speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in
comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in
advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户与互联网的交互方式正从隐式反馈转向显式文本交互，这为深度个性化提供了机会。但现有方法仅将用户历史视为扁平文本列表进行检索，未能建模反映用户兴趣动态特性的丰富时间和语义结构。

Method: MemWeaver构建了两个互补的记忆组件：行为记忆（捕捉具体用户行为）和认知记忆（表示长期偏好）。这两个组件都整合了时间和语义信息，但在不同抽象层次上工作。

Result: 在语言模型个性化（LaMP）基准测试上的实验验证了MemWeaver的有效性。

Conclusion: MemWeaver通过分层记忆框架成功捕捉了用户兴趣的时间演化和语义关系，为深度个性化生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The primary form of user-internet engagement is shifting from leveraging
implicit feedback signals, such as browsing and clicks, to harnessing the rich
explicit feedback provided by textual interactive behaviors. This shift unlocks
a rich source of user textual history, presenting a profound opportunity for a
deeper form of personalization. However, prevailing approaches offer only a
shallow form of personalization, as they treat user history as a flat list of
texts for retrieval and fail to model the rich temporal and semantic structures
reflecting dynamic nature of user interests. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MemWeaver}, a framework that weaves the user's entire textual history
into a hierarchical memory to power deeply personalized generation. The core
innovation of our memory lies in its ability to capture both the temporal
evolution of interests and the semantic relationships between different
activities. To achieve this, MemWeaver builds two complementary memory
components that both integrate temporal and semantic information, but at
different levels of abstraction: behavioral memory, which captures specific
user actions, and cognitive memory, which represents long-term preferences.
This dual-component memory serves as a unified representation of the user,
allowing large language models (LLMs) to reason over both concrete behaviors
and abstracted traits. Experiments on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP)
benchmark validate the efficacy of MemWeaver. Our code is

Result: 在三个多跳问答基准测试中，SubQRAG实现了持续且显著的改进，特别是在精确匹配分数上表现突出。

Conclusion: 子问题驱动的图RAG框架通过增强推理深度，有效解决了传统方法在复杂多跳问答中的局限性。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) effectively builds a
knowledge graph (KG) to connect disparate facts across a large document corpus.
However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning
needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete
evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose
SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG
decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable
sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the
graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands
it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples
used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a
structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments
on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent
and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion
(MKGC) aim to predict missing facts by leveraging LLMs' multilingual
understanding capabilities, improving the completeness of multilingual
knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing MKGC research underutilizes the
multilingual capabilities of LLMs and ignores the shareability of cross-lingual
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel MKGC framework that leverages
multilingual shared knowledge to significantly enhance performance through two
components: Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) and Iterative
Entity Reranking (IER). KL-GMoE efficiently models shared knowledge, while IER
significantly enhances its utilization. To evaluate our framework, we
constructed a mKG dataset containing 5 languages and conducted comprehensive
comparative experiments with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) MKGC method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves improvements of
5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% in the Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics,
respectively, compared with SOTA MKGC method. Further experimental analysis
revealed the properties of knowledge sharing in settings of unseen and
unbalanced languages. We have released the dataset and code for our work on

Result: ToolExpander显著提升了LLM的工具使用能力，特别是对小规模模型，改善了训练稳定性和整体性能。

Conclusion: ToolExpander框架有效解决了GRPO训练中的关键问题，为资源受限的LLM提供了稳定高效的训练方案。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) encounters a significant challenge: models often fail to produce
accurate responses, particularly in small-scale architectures. This limitation
not only diminishes performance improvements and undermines the potential of
GRPO but also frequently leads to mid-training collapse, adversely affecting
stability and final efficacy. To address these issues, we propose ToolExpander,
a novel framework that advances tool-oriented reinforcement learning for
resource-constrained LLMs through two key innovations:(1) Dynamic Multi-Round
Hard Sampling, which dynamically substitutes challenging samples(those without
correct outputs over 10 rollouts) with high-quality few-shot demonstrations
during training, coupled with an exponential learning rate decay strategy to
mitigate oscillations;(2) Self-Exemplifying Thinking, an enhanced GRPO
framework that eliminates KL divergence and incorporates adjusted clipping
coefficients, encouraging models to autonomously generate and analyze few-shot
examples via a minimal additional reward (0.01).Experimental results
demonstrate that ToolExpander significantly enhances tool-using capabilities in
LLMs, especially in weaker small-scale models, improving both training
stability and overall performance.

Motivation: 现有奖励模型依赖标量或成对判断，无法捕捉人类偏好的多维度特性，需要更可靠且可扩展的评分标准生成方法。

Method: 引入对比性评分标准生成(CRG)，通过对比偏好和拒绝响应来推导硬规则和原则，并使用拒绝采样提高可靠性。

Abstract: Reward modeling lies at the core of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), yet most existing reward models rely on scalar or pairwise
judgments that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of human preferences.
Recent studies have explored rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) that uses structured
natural language criteria that capture multiple dimensions of response quality.
However, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key
challenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale
collection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and
rubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive
evaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which
derives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit
qualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further improve
reliability by enforcing preference-label consistency via rejection sampling to
remove noisy rubrics. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our
rubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines
by 6.8%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and
biomedical benchmarks. Our results show that rubrics provide scalable alignment
signals that narrow the gap between costly human evaluation and automated
reward modeling, enabling a new principle-driven paradigm for LLM alignment.

Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large
language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based
chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or
search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning
unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to
explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit
from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling
mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for
advanced trajectory aggregation. \ This work enables parallel TTS for latent
reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two
uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive
Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM)
trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent
reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both
sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct
exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection.
Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in
continuous spaces. Code released at https://github.com/YRYangang/LatentTTS.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在MCQA任务中的推理策略，特别是验证在仅有选项输入的情况下，LLMs是否使用浅层策略，以及推理轨迹是否能揭示这些策略的真实性质。

Method: 让推理型LLMs在完整输入和仅有选项输入的情况下解决MCQs，分析推理轨迹的长度和忠实性，以评估策略的合理性。

Result: 测试时推理在完整输入和半数仅有选项情况下提高准确率；仅有选项的成功几乎不受推理轨迹长度影响；推理轨迹通过忠实性测试，显示使用如推断缺失问题等较少问题的策略。

Conclusion: 部分输入的成功并不总是缺陷，推理轨迹可用于区分有问题的数据和较少问题的推理策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now give reasoning before answering, excelling
in tasks like multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Yet, a concern is that
LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed
in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input
success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these
strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these
strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs;
test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the
time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely
affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass
faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring
missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is
always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic
data from less problematic reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with external tools have demonstrated
enhanced performance on complex reasoning tasks. The widespread adoption of
this tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific
tools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable
and specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating
tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability
bottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an
unstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an
expanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address
this, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an
unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system
first generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into
semantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent
framework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code
to extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a
reviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete
functional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous
question-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools
without loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning
performance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows
enhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific
increases.

Motivation: 传统基于结果的奖励方法在数学推理中容易导致奖励欺骗，模型可能通过错误推理过程得到正确答案，从而高估模型真实推理能力。

Method: 引入Rubric奖励模型(RRM)，这是一种过程导向的奖励函数，通过问题特定的评分标准评估整个推理轨迹，提供细粒度的校准奖励。

Result: 在四个数学基准测试中，RRM训练始终优于仅基于结果的监督学习，将AIME2024的Verified Pass@1024从26.7%提升到62.6%，奇迹步骤发生率减少71%。

Conclusion: 奖励解决方案过程对于构建不仅更准确而且更可靠的模型至关重要，过程导向奖励能有效缓解奖励欺骗问题。

Abstract: Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with
outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments,
we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading
to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is
evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the
correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic
analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure
modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct
output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a
strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the
model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To
mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a
process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory
against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained,
calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage
rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline,
RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across
four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from
26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%. Our work
demonstrates that rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models
that are not only more accurate but also more reliable.

Result: 在常识推理任务和有害基准测试中，该方法能保持拒绝行为和任务效用，缓解真实性与安全性之间的权衡

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效防止幻觉增加同时保持安全对齐，解决了真实性与安全性之间的权衡问题

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in
recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving
truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing
truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we
investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often
comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this
arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode
hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress
factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign
datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same
reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related
features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves
refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This
approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety
alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful
benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach
preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between
truthfulness and safety.

Abstract: Few-shot Multi-label Intent Detection (MID) is crucial for dialogue systems,
aiming to detect multiple intents of utterances in low-resource dialogue
domains. Previous studies focus on a two-stage pipeline. They first learn
representations of utterances with multiple labels and then use a
threshold-based strategy to identify multi-label results. However, these
methods rely on representation classification and ignore instance relations,
leading to error propagation. To solve the above issues, we propose a
multi-label joint learning method for few-shot MID in an end-to-end manner,
which constructs an instance relation learning network with label knowledge
propagation to eliminate error propagation. Concretely, we learn the
interaction relations between instances with class information to propagate
label knowledge between a few labeled (support set) and unlabeled (query set)
instances. With label knowledge propagation, the relation strength between
instances directly indicates whether two utterances belong to the same intent
for multi-label prediction. Besides, a dual relation-enhanced loss is developed
to optimize support- and query-level relation strength to improve performance.
Experiments show that we outperform strong baselines by an average of 9.54% AUC
and 11.19% Macro-F1 in 1-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: 多轮漂移可理解为可控的平衡现象而非必然衰减，为研究和缓解扩展交互中的上下文漂移提供了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at single-turn tasks such as instruction
following and summarization, yet real-world deployments require sustained
multi-turn interactions where user goals and conversational context persist and
evolve. A recurring challenge in this setting is context drift: the gradual
divergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns.
Unlike single-turn errors, drift unfolds temporally and is poorly captured by
static evaluation metrics. In this work, we present a study of context drift in
multi-turn interactions and propose a simple dynamical framework to interpret
its behavior. We formalize drift as the turn-wise KL divergence between the
token-level predictive distributions of the test model and a goal-consistent
reference model, and propose a recurrence model that interprets its evolution
as a bounded stochastic process with restoring forces and controllable
interventions. We instantiate this framework in both synthetic long-horizon
rewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations such as in $\tau$-Bench,
measuring drift for several open-weight LLMs that are used as user simulators.
Our experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather
than runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions
reliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions. Together,
these results suggest that multi-turn drift can be understood as a controllable
equilibrium phenomenon rather than as inevitable decay, providing a foundation
for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions.

Motivation: 大语言模型在剪枝时通常只使用少量校准数据，导致输出不匹配不可避免。直接最小二乘拟合容易过拟合校准集，破坏预训练权重。

Method: 在旋转约束下更新剪枝参数，保持输出表示的几何特性（范数和内积），同时重新对齐剪枝子空间与原始输出。设计了方差感知重要性评分，优先保留对主方向贡献大的维度。

Conclusion: 结合方差感知评分和旋转约束更新的方法能有效补偿误差，同时以几何保持的方式保留可能更重要的组件。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a rotation-constrained compensation method to
address the errors introduced by structured pruning of large language models
(LLMs). LLMs are trained on massive datasets and accumulate rich semantic
knowledge in their representation space. In contrast, pruning is typically
carried out with only a small amount of calibration data, which makes output
mismatches unavoidable. Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such
errors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively
modifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned
parameters under a rotation constraint. This constrained update preserves the
geometry of output representations (i.e., norms and inner products) and
simultaneously re-aligns the pruned subspace with the original outputs.
Furthermore, in rotation-constrained compensation, removing components that
strongly contribute to the principal directions of the output makes error
recovery difficult. Since input dimensions with large variance strongly affect
these principal directions, we design a variance-aware importance score that
ensures such dimensions are preferentially kept in the pruned model. By
combining this scoring rule with rotation-constrained updates, the proposed
method effectively compensates errors while retaining the components likely to
be more important in a geometry-preserving manner. In the experiments, we apply
the proposed method to LLaMA-7B and evaluate it on WikiText-2 and multiple
language understanding benchmarks. The results demonstrate consistently better
perplexity and task accuracy compared with existing baselines.

trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on
over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and
ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain
dimensions covering biological grounding, multi-omics alignment, fairness,

Abstract: Agentic RAG is a powerful technique for incorporating external information
that LLMs lack, enabling better problem solving and question answering.
However, suboptimal search behaviors exist widely, such as over-search
(retrieving information already known) and under-search (failing to search when
necessary), which leads to unnecessary overhead and unreliable outputs. Current
training methods, which typically rely on outcome-based rewards in a RL
framework, lack the fine-grained control needed to address these
inefficiencies. To overcome this, we introduce Hierarchical Process Rewards for
Efficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG), a training methodology that incorporates a
fine-grained, knowledge-grounded process reward into the RL training. Our
approach evaluates the necessity of each search decision on-the-fly by
decomposing the agent's reasoning trajectory into discrete, parsable steps. We
then apply a hierarchical reward function that provides an additional bonus
based on the proportion of optimal search and non-search steps, on top of
commonly used outcome and format rewards. Experiments on the Qwen2.5 and
Llama-3.2 models across seven diverse QA benchmarks show that our method
achieves average accuracies of 65.4% (3B) and 67.2% (7B). This is accomplished
while improving search efficiency, reducing the over-search rate to just 2.3%
and concurrently lowering the under-search rate. These results demonstrate the
efficacy of optimizing the reasoning process itself, not just the final
outcome. Further experiments and analysis demonstrate that HiPRAG shows good
generalizability across a wide range of RL algorithms, model families, sizes,
and types. This work demonstrates the importance and potential of fine-grained
control through RL, for improving the efficiency and optimality of reasoning
for search agents.

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证，GTD能生成高度任务自适应、稀疏且高效的通信拓扑，显著优于现有LLM智能体协作方法

Conclusion: GTD框架通过迭代引导的拓扑扩散过程，有效解决了多智能体系统中通信拓扑设计的复杂权衡问题

Abstract: The efficiency of multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs)
largely hinges on their communication topology. However, designing an optimal
topology is a non-trivial challenge, as it requires balancing competing
objectives such as task performance, communication cost, and robustness.
Existing frameworks often rely on static or hand-crafted topologies, which
inherently fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, leading to either
excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for
complex ones. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel generative
framework called \textit{Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)}. Inspired by
conditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis
as an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered
by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g.,
accuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization
towards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process
distinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better
navigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple
benchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly
task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly
outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration.

Abstract: Generative Information Retrieval is an emerging retrieval paradigm that
exhibits remarkable performance in monolingual scenarios.However, applying
these methods to multilingual retrieval still encounters two primary
challenges, cross-lingual identifier misalignment and identifier inflation. To
address these limitations, we propose Multilingual Generative Retrieval via
Cross-lingual Semantic Compression (MGR-CSC), a novel framework that unifies
semantically equivalent multilingual keywords into shared atoms to align
semantics and compresses the identifier space, and we propose a dynamic
multi-step constrained decoding strategy during retrieval. MGR-CSC improves
cross-lingual alignment by assigning consistent identifiers and enhances
decoding efficiency by reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that
MGR-CSC achieves outstanding retrieval accuracy, improving by 6.83% on
mMarco100k and 4.77% on mNQ320k, while reducing document identifiers length by
74.51% and 78.2%, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出AdaSwitch方法，通过动态结合on-policy和off-policy生成来解决小语言模型知识蒸馏中的训练-推理不匹配问题，在保持一致性的同时提高监督质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在严格延迟和计算约束下性能提升困难，现有知识蒸馏方法存在权衡：off-policy蒸馏提供高质量监督但引入训练-推理不匹配，on-policy方法保持一致性但依赖低质量学生输出。

Method: AdaSwitch方法在token级别动态结合on-policy和off-policy生成，让学生先探索自身预测，然后基于实时质量评估选择性整合教师指导。

Result: 在三个数据集和两个师生LLM对上的实验表明，AdaSwitch持续提高准确性，为蒸馏小语言模型提供了实用有效的方法，且额外开销可接受。

Conclusion: AdaSwitch通过动态切换策略同时保持了一致性和监督质量，为小语言模型的知识蒸馏提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are crucial for applications with strict latency
and computational constraints, yet achieving high performance remains
challenging. Knowledge distillation (KD) can transfer capabilities from large
teacher models, but existing methods involve trade-offs: off-policy
distillation provides high-quality supervision but introduces a
training-inference mismatch, while on-policy approaches maintain consistency
but rely on low-quality student outputs. To address these issues, we propose
AdaSwitch, a novel approach that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy
generation at the token level. AdaSwitch allows the student to first explore
its own predictions and then selectively integrate teacher guidance based on
real-time quality assessment. This approach simultaneously preserves
consistency and maintains supervision quality. Experiments on three datasets
with two teacher-student LLM pairs demonstrate that AdaSwitch consistently
improves accuracy, offering a practical and effective method for distilling
SLMs with acceptable additional overhead.

Conclusion: Translation Tangles为解决LLM翻译中的质量和公平性问题提供了系统性的评估工具，特别关注低资源语言的偏见检测。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has redefined Machine Translation
(MT), enabling context-aware and fluent translations across hundreds of
languages and textual domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs
often exhibit uneven performance across language families and specialized
domains. Moreover, recent evidence reveals that these models can encode and
amplify different biases present in their training data, posing serious
concerns for fairness, especially in low-resource languages. To address these
gaps, we introduce Translation Tangles, a unified framework and dataset for
evaluating the translation quality and fairness of open-source LLMs. Our
approach benchmarks 24 bidirectional language pairs across multiple domains
using different metrics. We further propose a hybrid bias detection pipeline
that integrates rule-based heuristics, semantic similarity filtering, and
LLM-based validation. We also introduce a high-quality, bias-annotated dataset
based on human evaluations of 1,439 translation-reference pairs. The code and
dataset are accessible on GitHub:

Motivation: 长链思维推理模型在复杂任务中表现出色，但存在过度思考问题——即使对简单查询也进行不必要的冗长推理，导致计算效率低下。现有研究缺乏对过度思考根本原因的理解。

Method: 开发TRACE系统：1) 将思维过程分解为最小完整子思维；2) 通过推断子思维间的语篇关系构建细粒度思维进展图；3) 识别相似查询的常见思维模式。

Result: 发现开放权重思维模型存在两种主要模式——探索者和晚期着陆，证实过度验证和过度探索是LLM过度思考的主要驱动因素。长思维模型在简单任务上速度慢5-20倍且无实质收益。

Conclusion: 提出了基于效用的过度思考定义，超越了基于长度的度量，为理解LLM思维进展和原则性管理过度思考提供了更深入的见解和实践指导。

Abstract: Models employing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have shown superior
performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, this capability introduces a
critical and often overlooked inefficiency -- overthinking -- models often
engage in unnecessarily extensive reasoning even for simple queries, incurring
significant computations without accuracy improvements. While prior work has
explored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our
understanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to
superficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner
workings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs'
thought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking
issue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on
simple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose
the thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring
discourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought
progression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for
topically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for
open-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides
evidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of
overthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a
utility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based
metrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of
LLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled
overthinking management.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效改善了语音交互模型的语言对齐能力，CS3-Bench为评估和改进代码切换语音交互系统提供了重要基准。

Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models has accelerated the
development of speech-to-speech interaction systems. While natural monolingual
interaction has been achieved, we find existing models exhibit deficiencies in
language alignment. In our proposed Code-Switching Speech-to-Speech Benchmark
(CS3-Bench), experiments on 7 mainstream models demonstrate a relative
performance drop of up to 66% in knowledge-intensive question answering and
varying degrees of misunderstanding in open-ended conversations. Starting from
a model with severe performance deterioration, we propose both data
constructions and training approaches to improve the language alignment
capabilities, specifically employing Chain of Recognition (CoR) to enhance
understanding and Keyword Highlighting (KH) to guide generation. Our approach
improves the knowledge accuracy from 25.14% to 46.13%, with open-ended

Motivation: 弱到强泛化方法存在噪声和偏差问题，限制了其实际应用效果，需要更稳健的方法来提升泛化能力。

Method: 利用隐式奖励与对比解码的结构等价性，提出ConG框架，通过对比预对齐和对齐后弱模型的输出来生成更高质量的训练样本。

Result: 在不同模型家族上的实证结果显示ConG带来了一致的改进，证明了该方法的通用性和有效性。

Conclusion: ConG有潜力推进弱到强泛化研究，为通向AGI提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization provides a promising paradigm for scaling large
language models (LLMs) by training stronger models on samples from aligned
weaker ones, without requiring human feedback or explicit reward modeling.
However, its robustness and generalization are hindered by the noise and biases
in weak-model outputs, which limit its applicability in practice. To address
this challenge, we leverage implicit rewards, which approximate explicit
rewards through log-likelihood ratios, and reveal their structural equivalence
with Contrastive Decoding (CD), a decoding strategy shown to reduce noise in
LLM generation. Building on this connection, we propose Contrastive
Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), a framework that employs contrastive
decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality
samples. This approach enables more reliable capability transfer, denoising,
and improved robustness, substantially mitigating the limitations of
traditional weak-to-strong methods. Empirical results across different model
families confirm consistent improvements, demonstrating the generality and
effectiveness of ConG. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential of
ConG to advance weak-to-strong generalization and provide a promising pathway
toward AGI.

<details>

Motivation: 方言主要是口语形式，非标准拼写在文本处理中存在问题，需要研究标准到方言的迁移在不同模态下的效果。

Method: 在德语和多种德语方言的书面和口语意图分类任务中，比较文本模型、语音模型和语音转录后文本处理的级联系统。

Result: 语音模型在方言数据上表现最佳，文本模型在标准数据上表现最好，级联系统在德语上落后于文本模型，但在方言数据上表现相对较好（当转录系统生成标准化输出时）。

Conclusion: 语音模型更适合处理方言数据，而文本模型更适合标准数据，级联系统在特定条件下对方言数据处理有效。

Abstract: Research on cross-dialectal transfer from a standard to a non-standard
dialect variety has typically focused on text data. However, dialects are
primarily spoken, and non-standard spellings are known to cause issues in text
processing. We compare standard-to-dialect transfer in three settings: text
models, speech models, and cascaded systems where speech first gets
automatically transcribed and then further processed by a text model. In our
experiments, we focus on German and multiple German dialects in the context of
written and spoken intent and topic classification. To that end, we release the
first dialectal audio intent classification dataset. We find that the
speech-only setup provides the best results on the dialect data while the
text-only setup works best on the standard data. While the cascaded systems lag
behind the text-only models for German, they perform relatively well on the
dialectal data if the transcription system generates normalized, standard-like
output.

Conclusion: MCBench通过客观、确定性和可代码验证的评估方法，为LLM的详细指令理解能力提供了有效的基准测试框架。

Abstract: Recent frontier-level LLMs have saturated many previously difficult
benchmarks, leaving little room for further differentiation. This progress
highlights the need for challenging benchmarks that provide objective
verification. In this paper, we introduce MCBench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate whether LLMs can execute string-matching NLP metrics by strictly
following step-by-step instructions. Unlike prior benchmarks that depend on
subjective judgments or general reasoning, MCBench offers an objective,
deterministic and codeverifiable evaluation. This setup allows us to
systematically test whether LLMs can maintain accurate step-by-step execution,
including instruction adherence, numerical computation, and long-range
consistency in handling intermediate results. To ensure objective evaluation of
these abilities, we provide a parallel reference code that can evaluate the
accuracy of LLM output. We provide three evaluative metrics and three benchmark
variants designed to measure the detailed instruction understanding capability
of LLMs. Our analyses show that MCBench serves as an effective and objective
tool for evaluating the capabilities of cutting-edge LLMs.

Method: 通过因果分析发现隐式主语作为查询神经元，在Transformer层中顺序激活对应的值神经元来积累信息。提出ACE框架，利用神经元级归因识别和编辑这些关键的查询-值路径

Result: 在GPT-J上比最先进方法提升9.44%，在Qwen3-8B上提升37.46%。分析还揭示了Qwen3中更细粒度的激活模式，以及值神经元语义可解释性由查询驱动的积累机制协调

Conclusion: 建立了一条基于内部推理机制原则性理解来推进知识编辑能力的新途径

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require efficient knowledge editing (KE) to
update factual information, yet existing methods exhibit significant
performance decay in multi-hop factual recall. This failure is particularly
acute when edits involve intermediate implicit subjects within reasoning
chains. Through causal analysis, we reveal that this limitation stems from an
oversight of how chained knowledge is dynamically represented and utilized at
the neuron level. We discover that during multi hop reasoning, implicit
subjects function as query neurons, which sequentially activate corresponding
value neurons across transformer layers to accumulate information toward the
final answer, a dynamic prior KE work has overlooked. Guided by this insight,
we propose ACE: Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing for Multi-hop Factual
Recall, a framework that leverages neuron-level attribution to identify and
edit these critical query-value (Q-V) pathways. ACE provides a mechanistically
grounded solution for multi-hop KE, empirically outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 9.44% on GPT-J and 37.46% on Qwen3-8B. Our analysis further reveals
more fine-grained activation patterns in Qwen3 and demonstrates that the
semantic interpretability of value neurons is orchestrated by query-driven
accumulation. These findings establish a new pathway for advancing KE
capabilities based on the principled understanding of internal reasoning
mechanisms.

Abstract: Automatic grading of subjective questions remains a significant challenge in
examination assessment due to the diversity in question formats and the
open-ended nature of student responses. Existing works primarily focus on a
specific type of subjective question and lack the generality to support
comprehensive exams that contain diverse question types. In this paper, we
propose a unified Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced auto-grading framework
that provides human-like evaluation for all types of subjective questions
across various domains. Our framework integrates four complementary modules to
holistically evaluate student answers. In addition to a basic text matching
module that provides a foundational assessment of content similarity, we
leverage the powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of LLMs to: (1)
compare key knowledge points extracted from both student and reference answers,
(2) generate a pseudo-question from the student answer to assess its relevance
to the original question, and (3) simulate human evaluation by identifying
content-related and non-content strengths and weaknesses. Extensive experiments
on both general-purpose and domain-specific datasets show that our framework
consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across multiple
grading metrics. Moreover, the proposed system has been successfully deployed
in real-world training and certification exams at a major e-commerce
enterprise.

progressively optimize learning by prioritizing suitable steps. Our method is
adaptable to various multi-step retrieval-augmented language models, including
those that use retrieval queries for reasoning paths or decomposed questions.
Extensive experiments show that StepER outperforms prior methods on multi-hop

Motivation: 大语言模型经常产生不完整或选择性省略关键信息的输出，在敏感领域这可能造成与事实错误类似的严重危害。

Method: 研究了三种自动评估策略：基于NLI的方法将文本分解为原子语句并使用自然语言推理识别缺失链接；基于Q&A的方法提取问答对并比较不同来源的响应；端到端方法直接使用LLM识别缺失内容。

Result: 实验表明简单的端到端方法相比更复杂的方法具有令人惊讶的有效性，但代价是鲁棒性、可解释性和结果粒度降低。

Conclusion: 端到端方法在检测LLM生成文本的完整性方面表现最佳，但需要权衡其鲁棒性和可解释性方面的不足。

Abstract: Despite demonstrating remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
large language models (LLMs) have also been found to frequently produce outputs
that are incomplete or selectively omit key information. In sensitive domains,
such omissions can result in significant harm comparable to that posed by
factual inaccuracies, including hallucinations. In this study, we address the
challenge of evaluating the comprehensiveness of LLM-generated texts, focusing
on the detection of missing information or underrepresented viewpoints. We
investigate three automated evaluation strategies: (1) an NLI-based method that
decomposes texts into atomic statements and uses natural language inference
(NLI) to identify missing links, (2) a Q&A-based approach that extracts
question-answer pairs and compares responses across sources, and (3) an
end-to-end method that directly identifies missing content using LLMs. Our
experiments demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of the simple end-to-end
approach compared to more complex methods, though at the cost of reduced
robustness, interpretability and result granularity. We further assess the
comprehensiveness of responses from several popular open-weight LLMs when
answering user queries based on multiple sources.

sources printed in Gothic script (Fraktur); and preparing for the creation of a
unified, cross-source dataset. Initial experiments with J. Gutslaff's 1648
dictionary indicate that LLMs have significant potential for semi-automatic
enrichment of dictionary information. When provided with sufficient context,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet accurately provided meanings and modern equivalents for 81%
of headword entries. In a text recognition experiment with A. T. Helle's 1732
dictionary, a zero-shot method successfully identified and structured 41% of
headword entries into error-free JSON-formatted output. For digitising the
Estonian-German dictionary section of A. W. Hupel's 1780 grammar, overlapping
tiling of scanned image files is employed, with one LLM being used for text
recognition and a second for merging the structured output. These findings
demonstrate that even for minor languages LLMs have a significant potential for
saving time and financial resources.

TL;DR: A²Search是一个无需标注的端到端训练框架，通过轨迹采样和证据验证自动检测模糊问题并收集替代答案，使用AnsF1奖励进行强化学习优化，在多个开放域问答基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有问答模型在处理允许多个有效答案的模糊问题时表现不佳，标准问答基准通常假设单一黄金答案，产生不合适的训练信号，而现有处理模糊性的方法依赖昂贵的手动标注，难以扩展到多跳数据集。

Method: 使用自动化流水线检测模糊问题并通过轨迹采样和证据验证收集替代答案，然后使用精心设计的AnsF1奖励进行强化学习优化，自然适应多个答案。

Result: 在八个开放域问答基准测试中实现新的最先进性能，A²Search-7B在四个多跳基准测试中平均AnsF1@1得分48.4%，优于所有强基线，包括更大的ReSearch-32B（46.2%）。

Conclusion: A²Search解决了模糊性问题并在基准测试中具有良好泛化能力，表明接受模糊性对于构建更可靠的问答系统至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning
(RL) have led to strong performance in open-domain question answering (QA).
However, existing models still struggle with questions that admit multiple
valid answers. Standard QA benchmarks, which typically assume a single gold
answer, overlook this reality and thus produce inappropriate training signals.
Existing attempts to handle ambiguity often rely on costly manual annotation,
which is difficult to scale to multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue.
In this paper, we present A$^2$Search, an annotation-free, end-to-end training
framework to recognize and handle ambiguity. At its core is an automated
pipeline that detects ambiguous questions and gathers alternative answers via
trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is then optimized with
RL using a carefully designed $\mathrm{AnsF1}$ reward, which naturally
accommodates multiple answers. Experiments on eight open-domain QA benchmarks
demonstrate that A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance. With
only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average $\mathrm{AnsF1}@1$
score of $48.4\%$ across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming all strong
baselines, including the substantially larger ReSearch-32B ($46.2\%$).
Extensive analyses further show that A$^2$Search resolves ambiguity and
generalizes across benchmarks, highlighting that embracing ambiguity is
essential for building more reliable QA systems. Our code, data, and model
weights can be found at https://github.com/zfj1998/A2Search

*Jingyuan Wang,Yankai Chen,Zhonghang Li,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LightReasoner是一个新颖框架，利用小型语言模型(SLM)来指导大型语言模型(LLM)的推理能力，通过专家-业余对比识别关键推理时刻，显著提升推理性能同时大幅降低资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调(SFT)方法资源密集，需要大量标注数据，且对所有token进行统一优化，而实际上只有少数token具有重要学习价值。本文探索小型模型能否通过揭示高价值推理时刻来指导大型模型。

Method: LightReasoner采用两阶段框架：1)采样阶段通过专家(LLM)与业余(SLM)模型的行为差异识别关键推理时刻，构建对比监督示例；2)微调阶段使用这些蒸馏示例对齐专家模型，增强其推理优势。

Result: 在七个数学基准测试中，LightReasoner将准确率提升高达28.1%，同时减少90%时间消耗、80%采样问题和99%微调token使用，且不依赖真实标签。

Conclusion: 通过将较弱的小型模型转化为有效的教学信号，LightReasoner为提升LLM推理能力提供了可扩展且资源高效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
reasoning, often through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, SFT is
resource-intensive, relying on large curated datasets, rejection-sampled
demonstrations, and uniform optimization across all tokens, even though only a
fraction carry meaningful learning value. In this work, we explore a
counterintuitive idea: can smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language
models (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the
latter's unique strength? We propose LightReasoner, a novel framework that
leverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a
weaker amateur model (SLM). LightReasoner operates in two stages: (1) a
sampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs
supervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur
contrast, and (2) a fine-tuning stage that aligns the expert model with these
distilled examples, amplifying its reasoning strengths. Across seven
mathematical benchmarks, LightReasoner improves accuracy by up to 28.1%, while
reducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token
usage by 99%, all without relying on ground-truth labels. By turning weaker
SLMs into effective teaching signals, LightReasoner offers a scalable and
resource-efficient approach for advancing LLM reasoning. Code is available at:

TL;DR: LLMs在社交推理任务中表现不佳，存在认知混乱和逻辑不一致问题。本文提出自适应世界模型增强推理机制，通过构建动态文本世界模型来跟踪实体状态和时间序列，显著提升社交推理准确性并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在数学和代码推理方面表现出色，但在社交推理任务中却遇到困难，表现出认知混乱、逻辑不一致以及混淆客观世界状态与主观信念状态的问题。

Method: 提出自适应世界模型增强推理机制，构建动态文本世界模型来跟踪实体状态和时间序列，动态监控推理轨迹中的混乱指示器，并通过提供清晰的世界状态描述进行及时干预。

Result: 在三个社交基准测试中显示出显著改进，准确率提升（如Hi-ToM中+10%），同时计算成本降低（最高减少33.8%的token使用）。

Conclusion: 该机制为在社交场景中部署LLMs提供了一个简单而有效的解决方案，模仿人类使用隐式世界模型来区分外部事件和内部信念的方式。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in mathematical and code reasoning,
we observe they struggle with social reasoning tasks, exhibiting cognitive
confusion, logical inconsistencies, and conflation between objective world
states and subjective belief states. Through deteiled analysis of DeepSeek-R1's
reasoning trajectories, we find that LLMs frequently encounter reasoning
impasses and tend to output contradictory terms like "tricky" and "confused"
when processing scenarios with multiple participants and timelines, leading to
erroneous reasoning or infinite loops. The core issue is their inability to
disentangle objective reality from agents' subjective beliefs. To address this,
we propose an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that constructs
a dynamic textual world model to track entity states and temporal sequences. It
dynamically monitors reasoning trajectories for confusion indicators and
promptly intervenes by providing clear world state descriptions, helping models
navigate through cognitive dilemmas. The mechanism mimics how humans use
implicit world models to distinguish between external events and internal
beliefs. Evaluations on three social benchmarks demonstrate significant
improvements in accuracy (e.g., +10% in Hi-ToM) while reducing computational
costs (up to 33.8% token reduction), offering a simple yet effective solution
for deploying LLMs in social contexts.

Motivation: 科学图表标题需要既准确又保持风格一致性来传达视觉信息，现有方法缺乏对作者特定写作风格的适应能力。

Method: 两阶段流程：第一阶段通过上下文过滤、DSPy的MIPROv2和SIMBA进行类别特定提示优化及候选标题选择；第二阶段使用少量样本提示和配置文件进行风格化精炼。

Result: 类别特定提示相比零样本和通用优化方法，ROUGE-1召回率提升+8.3%，精度损失限制在-2.8%，BLEU-4减少-10.9%；风格化精炼使BLEU得分提升40-48%，ROUGE提升25-27%。

Conclusion: 结合上下文理解和作者特定风格适应可以生成既科学准确又风格忠实于源论文的图表标题。

Abstract: Scientific figure captions require both accuracy and stylistic consistency to
convey visual information. Here, we present a domain-specific caption
generation system for the 3rd SciCap Challenge that integrates figure-related
textual context with author-specific writing styles using the LaMP-Cap dataset.
Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 combines context filtering,
category-specific prompt optimization via DSPy's MIPROv2 and SIMBA, and caption
candidate selection; Stage 2 applies few-shot prompting with profile figures
for stylistic refinement. Our experiments demonstrate that category-specific
prompts outperform both zero-shot and general optimized approaches, improving
ROUGE-1 recall by +8.3\% while limiting precision loss to -2.8\% and BLEU-4
reduction to -10.9\%. Profile-informed stylistic refinement yields 40--48\%
gains in BLEU scores and 25--27\% in ROUGE. Overall, our system demonstrates
that combining contextual understanding with author-specific stylistic
adaptation can generate captions that are both scientifically accurate and
stylistically faithful to the source paper.

Motivation: 现有LLM代理在部署时是静态的，无法从经验中学习，缺乏知识积累和持续改进的能力。

Method: 引入分层记忆模块，组织不同层次的经验，在执行子任务后自主反思轨迹，将原始轨迹转化为结构化经验并整合回记忆模块。

Result: 在TAC长时程生产力基准测试中取得新的SOTA性能，仅使用轻量级Gemini-2.5 Flash模型。代理随着经验积累展现出越来越强的任务完成能力和稳健的持续学习能力。

Conclusion: MUSE建立了一个能够实现现实世界生产力任务自动化的AI代理新范式，积累的经验具有强泛化性，能够零样本改进新任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, yet significant challenges persist when deploying them as AI
agents for real-world long-horizon tasks. Existing LLM agents suffer from a
critical limitation: they are test-time static and cannot learn from
experience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously
improve on the job. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE, a novel agent
framework that introduces an experience-driven, self-evolving system centered
around a hierarchical Memory Module. MUSE organizes diverse levels of
experience and leverages them to plan and execute long-horizon tasks across
multiple applications. After each sub-task execution, the agent autonomously
reflects on its trajectory, converting the raw trajectory into structured
experience and integrating it back into the Memory Module. This mechanism
enables the agent to evolve beyond its static pretrained parameters, fostering
continuous learning and self-evolution. We evaluate MUSE on the long-horizon
productivity benchmark TAC. It achieves new SOTA performance by a significant
margin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model. Sufficient Experiments
demonstrate that as the agent autonomously accumulates experience, it exhibits
increasingly superior task completion capabilities, as well as robust
continuous learning and self-evolution capabilities. Moreover, the accumulated
experience from MUSE exhibits strong generalization properties, enabling
zero-shot improvement on new tasks. MUSE establishes a new paradigm for AI
agents capable of real-world productivity task automation.

Motivation: 评估ChatGPT在日英翻译任务中的性能，探索不同提示策略的效果，并与商业翻译系统进行比较。

Method: 使用简单和增强提示进行日英翻译实验，进行自动评估和基于MQM的人工评估，比较句子级和文档级翻译，对比ChatGPT-3.5与ChatGPT-4以及两个商业翻译系统。

Result: 文档级翻译优于句子级翻译；增强提示与简单提示效果差异不明显；ChatGPT-3.5在自动评估中表现更好，但ChatGPT-4在流畅性方面更优；ChatGPT与知名翻译系统相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: ChatGPT在日英翻译任务中表现良好，文档级翻译策略更有效，不同版本在准确性和流畅性方面各有优势，整体性能可与商业翻译系统竞争。

Abstract: This study investigates ChatGPT for Japanese-English translation, exploring
simple and enhanced prompts and comparing against commercially available
translation engines. Performing both automatic and MQM-based human evaluations,
we found that document-level translation outperforms sentence-level translation
for ChatGPT. On the other hand, we were not able to determine if enhanced
prompts performed better than simple prompts in our experiments. We also
discovered that ChatGPT-3.5 was preferred by automatic evaluation, but a
tradeoff exists between accuracy (ChatGPT-3.5) and fluency (ChatGPT-4). Lastly,
ChatGPT yields competitive results against two widely-known translation

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型从参数知识中回忆气候常态的能力，发现LLMs能够编码非平凡的气候结构，但在高海拔和高纬度地区存在空间一致误差，且无法准确再现温度变化的空间模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在气候相关应用中的部署增加，理解其内部气候知识对于可靠性评估和错误信息风险分析至关重要，但目前LLMs回忆气候常态的能力尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 构建全球1度分辨率的网格查询，要求LLMs回忆1991-2020年7月平均2米气温，并将响应与ERA5再分析数据进行验证。

Result: LLMs能够捕捉纬度和地形模式，均方根误差为3-6°C，偏差为±1°C。但在1500米以上海拔地区性能急剧下降，RMSE达到5-13°C。包含地理上下文可将误差平均降低27%。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs能够捕捉当前气候分布，但无法准确表示长期温度变化的空间模式，这对理解气候动态至关重要。评估框架为量化LLMs中的参数气候知识提供了可复现基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for climate-related
applications, where understanding internal climatological knowledge is crucial
for reliability and misinformation risk assessment. Despite growing adoption,
the capacity of LLMs to recall climate normals from parametric knowledge
remains largely uncharacterized. We investigate the capacity of contemporary
LLMs to recall climate normals without external retrieval, focusing on a
prototypical query: mean July 2-m air temperature 1991-2020 at specified
locations. We construct a global grid of queries at 1{\deg} resolution land
points, providing coordinates and location descriptors, and validate responses
against ERA5 reanalysis. Results show that LLMs encode non-trivial climate
structure, capturing latitudinal and topographic patterns, with
root-mean-square errors of 3-6 {\deg}C and biases of $\pm$1 {\deg}C. However,
spatially coherent errors remain, particularly in mountains and high latitudes.
Performance degrades sharply above 1500 m, where RMSE reaches 5-13 {\deg}C
compared to 2-4 {\deg}C at lower elevations. We find that including geographic
context (country, city, region) reduces errors by 27% on average, with larger
models being most sensitive to location descriptors. While models capture the
global mean magnitude of observed warming between 1950-1974 and 2000-2024, they
fail to reproduce spatial patterns of temperature change, which directly relate
to assessing climate change. This limitation highlights that while LLMs may
capture present-day climate distributions, they struggle to represent the
regional and local expression of long-term shifts in temperature essential for
understanding climate dynamics. Our evaluation framework provides a
reproducible benchmark for quantifying parametric climate knowledge in LLMs and
complements existing climate communication assessments.

Motivation: 传统集中式或完全本地训练方法在隐私保护和个性化之间难以平衡，联邦学习面临有限客户端数据下的过拟合问题以及多轮训练后遗忘全局信息导致泛化能力差。

Result: 实验结果表明FedDTRE能够提升对话模型性能，改善对话生成质量。

Conclusion: FedDTRE通过可信度评估机制有效解决了联邦对话生成中的过拟合和全局信息遗忘问题，提高了模型的泛化能力和对话质量。

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, dialogue systems have
become a prominent form of human-computer interaction. However, traditional
centralized or fully local training approaches face challenges in balancing
privacy preservation and personalization due to data privacy concerns and
heterogeneous device capabilities. Federated learning, as a representative
distributed paradigm, offers a promising solution. However, existing methods
often suffer from overfitting under limited client data and tend to forget
global information after multiple training rounds, leading to poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose FedDTRE, a Federated
adaptive aggregation strategy for Dialogue generation based on Trustworthiness
Evaluation. Instead of directly replacing local models with the global model,
FedDTRE leverages trustworthiness scores of both global and local models on a
fairness-oriented evaluation dataset to dynamically regulate the global model's
contribution during local updates. Experimental results demonstrate that
FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of
dialogue generation.

Motivation: 探究在常识推理领域，人类作为"专家"的判断是否容易受到LLM生成论证的影响，以及这种影响的程度。

Method: 收集了3,000个人类合理性判断和13,600个LLM判断，通过呈现LLM生成的支持/反对理由来观察评分变化。

Result: 当存在LLM生成的支持理由时，人类平均合理性评分上升；存在反对理由时，评分下降，表明人类认为这些理由具有说服力。LLM实验显示出相似的影响模式。

Conclusion: LLM可用于研究人类认知，但也带来实际担忧：即使在人类擅长的常识领域，LLM仍可能对人们的信念产生显著影响。

Abstract: We investigate the degree to which human plausibility judgments of
multiple-choice commonsense benchmark answers are subject to influence by
(im)plausibility arguments for or against an answer, in particular, using
rationales generated by LLMs. We collect 3,000 plausibility judgments from
humans and another 13,600 judgments from LLMs. Overall, we observe increases
and decreases in mean human plausibility ratings in the presence of
LLM-generated PRO and CON rationales, respectively, suggesting that, on the
whole, human judges find these rationales convincing. Experiments with LLMs
reveal similar patterns of influence. Our findings demonstrate a novel use of
LLMs for studying aspects of human cognition, while also raising practical
concerns that, even in domains where humans are ``experts'' (i.e., common
sense), LLMs have the potential to exert considerable influence on people's
beliefs.

Result: 推理显著改善了谈判结果（GPT-5性能提升31.4%），但计算成本增加近400%。开源模型在德语或意大利语谈判时会切换到英语进行内部推理，而商业模型能保持语言一致性。

Conclusion: 推理能力能有效提升LLM的谈判表现，但成本高昂；多语言推理存在显著差异，这可能影响通过披露推理痕迹获得的可解释性收益。

Abstract: Negotiation is a fundamental challenge for AI agents, as it requires an
ability to reason strategically, model opponents, and balance cooperation with
competition. We conduct the first comprehensive study systematically evaluating
the effect of (LLM-)reasoning on the negotiation abilities of both commercial
and open-weight LLMs, and do this across three languages. Using a self-play
setup across three diverse dialogue games, we analyse trade-offs between
performance and cost, the language consistency of reasoning processes, and the
nature of strategic adaptation exhibited by models. Our findings show that
enabling reasoning-that is, scaling test time compute-significantly improves
negotiation outcomes by enhancing collaboration and helping models overcome
task complexities, but comes at a substantial computational cost: reasoning
improves GPT-5's performance by 31.4 % while increasing its cost by nearly 400
%. Most critically, we uncover a significant multilingual reasoning
distinction: open-weight models consistently switch to English for their
internal reasoning steps, even when negotiating in German or Italian (and thus
possibly impacting potential explainability gains through the disclosure of
reasoning traces), while leading commercial models maintain language
consistency between their reasoning and final output.

Motivation: 由于每个语言模型都有自己的词汇表作为可能的标记集合，它们在下一个标记分布级别（如模型集成）上难以相互协作。

Method: 建立无损词汇缩减的理论框架，高效地将给定的自回归语言模型转换为具有任意小词汇量的模型，而不损失任何准确性。

Result: 通过最大公共词汇，不同分词的语言模型可以有效地相互协作。

Conclusion: 无损词汇缩减框架为语言模型间的协作提供了理论基础，解决了不同分词方式带来的兼容性问题。

Abstract: Tokenization -- the process of decomposing a given text into a sequence of
subwords called tokens -- is one of the key components in the development of
language models. Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts
token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the
previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text
generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of
possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of
next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a
theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently
converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an
arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. As an application,
we demonstrate that language models with different tokenization can cooperate
with each other efficiently through their maximal common vocabulary.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了GPT-5-nano和Gemini-2.5-flash-lite在检测未披露赞助内容方面的表现，开发了法律推理错误分类法，发现添加监管文本能提高解释质量但不一定提高检测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网红营销模糊了有机内容和赞助内容的界限，现有检测方法缺乏法律依据或作为不透明的"黑箱"运作，需要基于法律知识的透明检测方法。

Method: 使用1,143个Instagram帖子，比较两种模型在三种提示策略下的表现，控制法律知识水平，开发推理错误分类法，结合定量和定性评估策略。

Result: 两种模型在分类赞助内容方面表现强劲（F1最高0.93），但在模糊案例中性能下降超过10个百分点。常见错误包括引用遗漏（28.57%）、不明确引用（20.71%），隐藏广告的错误率最高（28.57%）。

Conclusion: 本研究为监管合规技术提供了LLM生成法律推理常见错误的分类法，确保自动审核不仅准确而且法律稳健，支持广告监管机构在坚实法律基础上自动化审核流程。

Abstract: The rise of influencer marketing has blurred boundaries between organic
content and sponsored content, making the enforcement of legal rules relating
to transparency challenging. Effective regulation requires applying legal
knowledge with a clear purpose and reason, yet current detection methods of
undisclosed sponsored content generally lack legal grounding or operate as
opaque "black boxes". Using 1,143 Instagram posts, we compare gpt-5-nano and
gemini-2.5-flash-lite under three prompting strategies with controlled levels
of legal knowledge provided. Both models perform strongly in classifying
content as sponsored or not (F1 up to 0.93), though performance drops by over
10 points on ambiguous cases. We further develop a taxonomy of reasoning
errors, showing frequent citation omissions (28.57%), unclear references
(20.71%), and hidden ads exhibiting the highest miscue rate (28.57%). While
adding regulatory text to the prompt improves explanation quality, it does not
consistently improve detection accuracy. The contribution of this paper is
threefold. First, it makes a novel addition to regulatory compliance technology
by providing a taxonomy of common errors in LLM-generated legal reasoning to
evaluate whether automated moderation is not only accurate but also legally
robust, thereby advancing the transparent detection of influencer marketing
content. Second, it features an original dataset of LLM explanations annotated
by two students who were trained in influencer marketing law. Third, it
combines quantitative and qualitative evaluation strategies for LLM
explanations and critically reflects on how these findings can support
advertising regulatory bodies in automating moderation processes on a solid
legal foundation.

TL;DR: 提出CLoVE和GloVE方法，从LLM作为评判者的决策中提取可验证的概念化全局策略，以理解LLM评判的潜在偏见和风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM作为评判者被大规模使用来替代人类标注，需要理解其潜在的偏见和风险。

Method: 1) CLoVE：生成可验证的、基于概念的对比性局部解释；2) GloVE：通过迭代聚类、总结和验证将局部规则浓缩为全局策略。

Result: 在7个内容危害检测基准数据集上评估，提取的全局策略对LLM评判决策具有高忠实度，并对文本扰动和对抗攻击具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 全局策略能有效反映LLM评判的决策逻辑，用户研究显示用户对全局策略的理解和满意度良好。

Abstract: Using LLMs to evaluate text, that is, LLM-as-a-judge, is increasingly being
used at scale to augment or even replace human annotations. As such, it is
imperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In
this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based
global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms:
1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates
verifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global
Verifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and
verification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on
seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that
the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the
LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to
text perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study
to evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.

Motivation: LLM作为自动评估器存在判断偏好偏差，倾向于偏爱自身生成的回答，这降低了评估的可靠性。

Method: 将多个LLM评估模型集成到多智能体系统中，模拟交互式客户端-服务器轮询机制，对每个客户端智能体进行无监督优化。

Result: Genii在实验中优于基于标注判断数据训练的监督模型，且无需人工标注。在不同客户端智能体的轮询过程中持续提升性能，即使使用较弱的模型作为服务器智能体。

Conclusion: Genii有效缓解了LLM评估模型的判断偏好偏差，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic evaluators, commonly referred to as
LLM-as-a-Judge, have also attracted growing attention. This approach plays a
vital role in aligning LLMs with human judgments, providing accurate and
reliable assessments. However, LLM-based judgment models often exhibit judgment
preference bias during the evaluation phase, tending to favor responses
generated by themselves, undermining the reliability of their judgments. This
paper introduces the Group-Based Polling Optimization (Genii), an unsupervised
multi-agent collaborative optimization framework that mitigates the inherent
judgment preference bias of judgment models. Specifically, Genii integrates
various LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates the
interactive client-server polling mechanism to optimize each client agent
unsupervisedly. Our experiments demonstrate that Genii outperforms supervised
models trained on annotated judgment data, while requiring no human-labeled
annotations. Genii consistently improves performance across different client
agents during the polling, even when weaker models act as server agents.
Further analysis reveals that Genii effectively mitigates judgment preference
bias of LLM-based judgment models, demonstrating its effectiveness. All codes

Abstract: The utilization of conversational AI systems by leveraging Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to solve customer problems has been on
the rise with the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
absence of a company-specific dedicated knowledge base is a major barrier to
the integration of conversational AI systems in contact centers. To this end,
we introduce AI Knowledge Assist, a system that extracts knowledge in the form
of question-answer (QA) pairs from historical customer-agent conversations to
automatically build a knowledge base. Fine-tuning a lightweight LLM on internal
data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger
closed-source LLMs. More specifically, empirical evaluation on 20 companies
demonstrates that the proposed AI Knowledge Assist system that leverages the
LLaMA-3.1-8B model eliminates the cold-start gap in contact centers by
achieving above 90% accuracy in answering information-seeking questions. This
enables immediate deployment of RAG-powered chatbots.

Conclusion: 这是首个将指令预训练应用于商业对话数据的工作，为行业如何利用专有数据集进行领域适应提供了见解。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their
adoption in real-world industrial scenarios for various natural language
processing tasks. However, the high inference cost of large-scale LLMs makes
their deployment impractical, necessitating the use of smaller models. Despite
their efficiency, smaller LLMs lack robust zero-shot instruction-following
capabilities across diverse domains, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
user requirements. Traditional fine-tuning approaches exacerbate this issue by
inducing catastrophic forgetting, reducing the model's generalization ability
for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual
Instruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual
pre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for
business conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that
rely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and
responses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling
better instruction generalization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that
DACIP-RC significantly improves zero-shot generalization across a wide range of
business conversational tasks, including meeting summarization, action item
generation, and call purpose identification. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work to apply instruction pre-training on business conversational
data, providing insights into how industries can leverage proprietary datasets
for domain adaptation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两个基准测试来评估LLM的过度安全拒绝问题，并开发了三种轻量级方法来缓解此问题，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常对包含类似不安全查询术语的良性请求产生错误的拒绝，这影响了模型的实际可用性。

Method: 引入了XSB和MS-XSB两个基准测试，并使用忽略词指令、提示重述和注意力引导三种后处理方法。

Result: 这些策略显著提高了安全提示的合规性，同时保持了强大的安全保护能力。

Conclusion: 建立了一个可复现的框架来诊断和缓解过度拒绝问题，为更安全、更有用的LLM部署提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce false refusals, declining
benign requests that contain terms resembling unsafe queries. We address this
challenge by introducing two comprehensive benchmarks: the Exaggerated Safety
Benchmark (XSB) for single-turn prompts, annotated with "Focus" keywords that
identify refusal-inducing triggers, and the Multi-turn Scenario-based
Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (MS-XSB), which systematically evaluates refusal
calibration in realistic, context-rich dialog settings. Our benchmarks reveal
that exaggerated refusals persist across diverse recent LLMs and are especially
pronounced in complex, multi-turn scenarios. To mitigate these failures, we
leverage post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deploy
three lightweight, model-agnostic approaches, ignore-word instructions, prompt
rephrasing, and attention steering, at inference time, all without retraining
or parameter access. Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models
demonstrate that these strategies substantially improve compliance on safe
prompts while maintaining robust safety protections. Our findings establish a
reproducible framework for diagnosing and mitigating exaggerated refusals,
highlighting practical pathways to safer and more helpful LLM deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型存在"过度思考"问题，在简单任务上生成不必要的冗长推理。现有方法如长度惩罚或路由机制通常是启发式且任务特定的，缺乏自适应推理的通用框架。

Method: 采用强化学习框架结合长度感知优化，统一处理多种推理格式。除了自然语言推理，还整合了视觉理解和可执行代码，通过代码执行大幅减少token成本。

Result: ARM2在保持与传统GRPO训练模型相当性能的同时，平均减少超过70%的token使用量。在多种任务上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: ARM2提供了一个通用的自适应推理框架，通过整合多模态理解和可执行代码，在保持性能的同时显著提高推理效率。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from the ``over-thinking''
problem, generating unnecessarily long reasoning on simple tasks. Some
strategies have been proposed to mitigate this issue, such as length penalties
or routing mechanisms, but they are typically heuristic and task-specific,
lacking a general framework for adaptive reasoning. In this paper, we present
ARM2, a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and
efficiency across multiple formats through a reinforcement learning framework
augmented with length-aware optimization. Beyond conventional natural language
inference, ARM2 integrates vision understanding, extending its applicability to
multimodal. Moreover, ARM2 integrates executable code into reasoning, enabling
substantial reductions in token cost while preserving task performance compared
to long CoT. Experiments demonstrate that ARM2 achieves performance on par with
traditional reasoning models trained with GRPO, while reducing token usage by
over 70% on average. We further conduct extensive analyses to validate the
effectiveness of ARM2 and the soundness of its design.

Method: 开发了MetricalARGS分类法，包含分析、检索、生成、支持四个维度，并以泰卢固语为例说明该分类法的实际应用。

Result: 创建了首个专门针对格律诗的NLP任务分类体系，为评估LLM在诗歌相关任务中的能力提供了系统框架。

Conclusion: MetricalARGS通过格律诗的视角，为理解当代LLM的能力和局限性提供了更广阔的可能性。

Abstract: Prior NLP work studying poetry has focused primarily on automatic poem
generation and summarization. Many languages have well-studied traditions of
poetic meter which enforce constraints on a poem in terms of syllable and
phoneme patterns. Such advanced literary forms offer opportunities for probing
deeper reasoning and language understanding in Large Language Models (LLMs) and
their ability to follow strict pre-requisites and rules. In this paper, we
introduce MetricalARGS, the first taxonomy of poetry-related NLP tasks designed
to evaluate LLMs on metrical poetry across four dimensions: Analysis,
Retrieval, Generation, and Support. We discuss how these tasks relate to
existing NLP tasks, addressing questions around datasets and evaluation
metrics. Taking Telugu as our example language, we illustrate how the taxonomy
can be used in practice. MetricalARGS highlights the broader possibilities for
understanding the capabilities and limitations of today's LLMs through the lens
of metrical poetry.

Motivation: 解决LLM在专业领域性能下降的问题，传统方法依赖昂贵的参数更新，而本文提出更轻量级的方法来避免过拟合并应对数据稀缺。

Method: 使用训练免费的组相对策略优化，在少量真实数据上进行多轮学习，迭代提炼高质量经验知识作为token先验，在LLM API调用中指导模型行为。

Conclusion: Training-Free GRPO是一种成本效益高的解决方案，无需参数更新即可有效提升LLM代理性能，特别适用于数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated their
promising general capabilities. However, their performance in specialized
real-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating
external tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic
reinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely
on costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output
distribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the
output distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which
is a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data
scarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we
propose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO),
a cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any
parameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage
instead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling
high-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal
ground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is
seamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments
on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that
Training-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly
improves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples,
Training-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training
data and cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在知识记忆、指令跟随和推理方面表现出色，但其记忆检索和巩固机制仍不清楚，需要深入理解LLM的工作原理。

Method: 提出函数令牌假说，通过二分图分析证明少数函数令牌激活大部分特征，并通过案例研究展示函数令牌如何激活最具预测性的特征来指导下一个令牌预测。

Result: 实验证据支持函数令牌假说，显示函数令牌在激活特征和指导预测中的关键作用，预训练损失主要由预测函数令牌后的内容令牌主导。

Conclusion: 函数令牌假说为理解大语言模型的记忆检索和巩固机制提供了新的理论框架，揭示了函数令牌在模型工作流程中的核心地位。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) stems from their
ability to consolidate vast amounts of knowledge into the memory during
pre-training and to retrieve it from the memory during inference, enabling
advanced capabilities such as knowledge memorization, instruction-following and
reasoning. However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in
LLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token
hypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens
activate the most predictive features from context and govern next token
prediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens
(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of
learned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory
consolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in
linguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and
conjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental
evidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show
that a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features. Case
studies further reveal how function tokens activate the most predictive
features from context to direct next token prediction. We also find that during
pre-training, the training loss is dominated by predicting the next content
tokens following function tokens, which forces the function tokens to select
the most predictive features from context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在微调恶意或不正确内容后，是否会在高风险情境下表现出广泛的不诚实和欺骗行为，即所谓的涌现性错位现象。

Method: 对开源LLMs在不同领域进行错位微调，并在下游混合任务和模拟人机交互环境中测试其行为变化。

Result: LLMs在微调后表现出广泛的不诚实行为；仅1%的错位数据就能使诚实行为下降20%以上；10%的偏见用户群体就能无意中加剧AI助手的不诚实。

Conclusion: 涌现性错位风险不仅存在于直接微调中，也存在于下游混合任务和实际人机交互中，需要引起重视。

Abstract: Previous research has shown that LLMs finetuned on malicious or incorrect
completions within narrow domains (e.g., insecure code or incorrect medical
advice) can become broadly misaligned to exhibit harmful behaviors, which is
called emergent misalignment. In this work, we investigate whether this
phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of
dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under
pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced
LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty.
Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined
finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment
data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior
over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction
environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the
assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned
unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user
population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the
domain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate
that this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in
downstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.

Abstract: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a
comprehensive understanding of public sentiment and reactions. Despite the
availability of numerous public datasets on COVID-19, some reaching volumes of
up to 100 billion data points, challenges persist regarding the availability of
labeled data and the presence of coarse-grained or inappropriate sentiment
labels. In this paper, we introduce SenWave, a novel fine-grained
multi-language sentiment analysis dataset specifically designed for analyzing
COVID-19 tweets, featuring ten sentiment categories across five languages. The
dataset comprises 10,000 annotated tweets each in English and Arabic, along
with 30,000 translated tweets in Spanish, French, and Italian, derived from
English tweets. Additionally, it includes over 105 million unlabeled tweets
collected during various COVID-19 waves. To enable accurate fine-grained
sentiment classification, we fine-tuned pre-trained transformer-based language
models using the labeled tweets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of the
evolving emotional landscape across languages, countries, and topics, revealing
significant insights over time. Furthermore, we assess the compatibility of our
dataset with ChatGPT, demonstrating its robustness and versatility in various
applications. Our dataset and accompanying code are publicly accessible on the
repository\footnote{https://github.com/gitdevqiang/SenWave}. We anticipate that
this work will foster further exploration into fine-grained sentiment analysis
for complex events within the NLP community, promoting more nuanced
understanding and research innovations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个包含反因果声明的新数据集，解决了现有因果提取研究中忽视反因果关系的问题，并证明该数据集能有效提升模型区分正反因果的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果提取数据集只关注支持因果关系的"正因果"声明，完全忽略了反驳因果关系的"反因果"声明，甚至错误地将反因果标注为正因果。

Method: 通过文献综述建立理论基础，制定严格的标注指南，在Causal News Corpus基础上增加反因果声明标注，获得较高的标注者间一致性（Cohen's κ=0.74）。

Result: 研究表明，未使用反因果数据训练的模型倾向于将反因果错误分类为正因果，而基于新数据集的训练能有效缓解这一问题，使transformer模型能有效区分正反因果关系。

Conclusion: 整合反因果声明对于因果推理至关重要，新数据集能够显著提升模型在因果提取任务中的性能，特别是在区分正反因果关系方面。

Abstract: Research on causality extraction from text has so far almost entirely
neglected counterclaims. Existing causality extraction datasets focus solely on
"procausal" claims, i.e., statements that support a relationship. "Concausal"
claims, i.e., statements that refute a relationship, are entirely ignored or
even accidentally annotated as procausal. We address this shortcoming by
developing a new dataset that integrates concausality. Based on an extensive
literature review, we first show that concausality is an integral part of
causal reasoning on incomplete knowledge. We operationalize this theory in the
form of a rigorous guideline for annotation and then augment the Causal News
Corpus with concausal statements, obtaining a substantial inter-annotator
agreement of Cohen's $\kappa=0.74$. To demonstrate the importance of
integrating concausal statements, we show that models trained without concausal
relationships tend to misclassify these as procausal instead. Based on our new
dataset, this mistake can be mitigated, enabling transformers to effectively
distinguish pro- and concausality.

TL;DR: WaltzRL是一个多智能体强化学习框架，通过对话智能体和反馈智能体的协作训练，在保持大语言模型帮助性的同时提升安全性，显著减少不安全响应和过度拒绝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的安全保障模型往往完全拒绝包含不安全内容的部分，这会加剧过度拒绝问题，且无法为被拒绝的查询提供细致指导。需要在帮助性和无害性之间找到更好的平衡。

Method: 提出WaltzRL框架，将安全对齐建模为协作的正和博弈。联合训练对话智能体和反馈智能体，使用动态改进奖励机制，根据对话智能体整合反馈的效果进行奖励。推理时改进而非丢弃不安全或过度拒绝的响应。

Result: 在五个不同数据集上的实验表明，WaltzRL显著减少了不安全响应（如WildJailbreak上从39.0%降至4.6%）和过度拒绝（OR-Bench上从45.3%降至9.9%），优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: WaltzRL通过让对话和反馈智能体共同进化并自适应应用反馈，在不降低通用能力的前提下增强了大语言模型的安全性，推进了帮助性和无害性之间的帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Harnessing the power of LLMs requires a delicate dance between being helpful
and harmless. This creates a fundamental tension between two competing
challenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content,
and a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current
approaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely
reject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music
entirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance
for queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we
propose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
formulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL
jointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is
incentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and
helpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a
Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the
conversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or
overrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than
discarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent
and only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency
on safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets,
demonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g.,
from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on
OR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and
feedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances
LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto
front between helpfulness and harmlessness.

Method: 在受控环境中，使用对比解码方法从好模型和坏模型之间的相对差异中采样合成语料库，然后将合成数据与原始训练数据混合。

Result: 在语言建模目标和一系列下游任务上，混合合成数据和真实数据的训练都能提高性能。对比解码的合成数据对需要推理技能的任务更有帮助，而传统采样的合成数据对依赖表层语言能力的任务更有益。

Conclusion: 合成数据与真实数据的混合训练是有效的，不同类型的合成数据对不同任务有特定的优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on huge amounts of textual data, and
concerns have been raised that the limits of such data may soon be reached. A
potential solution is to train on synthetic data sampled from LLMs. In this
work, we build on this idea and investigate the benefits of contrastive
decoding for generating synthetic corpora. In a controlled setting, we
experiment with sampling corpora using the relative difference between a good
and bad model trained on the same original corpus of 100 million words. By
amplifying the signal from a model that has better performance, we create a
synthetic corpus and mix it with the original training data. Our findings show
that training on a mixture of synthesized and real data improves performance on
the language modeling objective and a range of downstream tasks. In particular,
we see that training with a mix of synthetic data from contrastive decoding
benefits tasks that require more reasoning skills, while synthetic data from
traditional sampling helps more on tasks dependent on surface level linguistic
capabilities.

TL;DR: DeepMiner是一个通过高难度训练任务和动态上下文窗口来激发多轮智能体深度推理能力的新框架，在多个搜索智能体基准测试中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在具有长视野交互的多轮智能体中激发深度推理能力，需要解决训练数据挑战性和上下文管理的问题。

Method: 提出反向构造方法从真实网络源生成复杂但可验证的问答对，并设计动态上下文管理策略，使用滑动窗口机制处理长视野上下文。

Result: 在Qwen3-32B上通过强化学习开发的DeepMiner-32B在BrowseComp-en上达到33.5%准确率，比之前最佳开源智能体提升近20个百分点，并在多个基准测试中表现一致提升。

Conclusion: DeepMiner有效解决了现有多轮交互系统的上下文限制，能够在标准32k上下文长度内支持近100轮的持续交互。

Abstract: While recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated cognitive
behaviors through reinforcement learning, existing approaches struggle to
invoke deep reasoning capabilities in multi-turn agents with long-horizon
interactions. We propose DeepMiner, a novel framework that elicits such
abilities by introducing high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context
window. DeepMiner presents a reverse construction method to generate complex
but verifiable question-answer pairs from authentic web sources, which ensures
the challenge and reliability of training data while injecting cognitive
capabilities into multi-turn reasoning scenarios. We further design an elegant
yet effective dynamic context management strategy for both training and
inference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency
on external summarization models, thereby efficiently empowering the model to
handle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts. Through reinforcement
learning on Qwen3-32B, we develop DeepMiner-32B, which achieves substantial
performance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks. DeepMiner
attains 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing the previous best
open-source agent by almost 20 percentage points, and demonstrates consistent
improvements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA. Notably, our
dynamic context management enables sustained interactions of nearly 100 turns
within standard 32k context length, effectively addressing the context
limitations that constrain existing multi-turn interaction systems.

*Taisei Yamamoto,Ryoma Kumon,Danushka Bollegala,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过神经元级分析识别出驱动大语言模型文化行为的神经元，发现了文化通用神经元和文化特定神经元，它们集中在浅层到中层MLP层中，仅占所有神经元的不到1%。抑制这些神经元会显著降低文化基准测试性能，但对一般自然语言理解影响很小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在全球部署，确保其公平和全面的文化理解很重要。但现有模型存在文化偏见，对代表性不足文化的认知有限，且其文化理解机制尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用神经元级分析，引入基于梯度的评分方法和额外过滤进行精确细化，识别文化通用神经元和文化特定神经元。

Result: 识别出的神经元集中在浅层到中层MLP层，仅占所有神经元的不到1%。抑制这些神经元使文化基准测试性能下降高达30%，但一般NLU基准测试性能基本不受影响。文化特定神经元不仅支持目标文化知识，还支持相关文化知识。

Conclusion: 训练NLU基准测试可能会削弱模型的文化理解能力，特别是当更新包含大量文化通用神经元的模块时。这些发现为理解LLM内部机制提供了见解，并为模型训练和工程提供了实用指导。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed worldwide, ensuring
their fair and comprehensive cultural understanding is important. However, LLMs
exhibit cultural bias and limited awareness of underrepresented cultures, while
the mechanisms underlying their cultural understanding remain underexplored. To
fill this gap, we conduct a neuron-level analysis to identify neurons that
drive cultural behavior, introducing a gradient-based scoring method with
additional filtering for precise refinement. We identify both culture-general
neurons contributing to cultural understanding regardless of cultures, and
culture-specific neurons tied to an individual culture. These neurons account
for less than 1% of all neurons and are concentrated in shallow to middle MLP
layers. We validate their role by showing that suppressing them substantially
degrades performance on cultural benchmarks (by up to 30%), while performance
on general natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks remains largely
unaffected. Moreover, we show that culture-specific neurons support knowledge
of not only the target culture, but also related cultures. Finally, we
demonstrate that training on NLU benchmarks can diminish models' cultural
understanding when we update modules containing many culture-general neurons.
These findings provide insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and offer
practical guidance for model training and engineering. Our code is available at

TL;DR: AutoRed是一个无需种子指令的自由形式对抗提示生成框架，通过角色引导的指令生成和反射循环迭代优化提示，构建了红队数据集并显著提升了攻击成功率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红队方法依赖种子指令，限制了对抗提示的语义多样性，需要开发更有效的自由形式红队方法来评估LLM安全性。

Method: 两阶段框架：角色引导的对抗指令生成和反射循环迭代优化；引入验证器评估提示危害性而无需查询目标模型。

Result: 构建了AutoRed-Medium和AutoRed-Hard两个数据集，在8个最先进LLM上评估，相比基线方法获得更高的攻击成功率和更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于种子的方法存在局限性，自由形式红队方法在LLM安全评估方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for the development of
trustworthy AI applications. Existing red teaming methods often rely on seed
instructions, which limits the semantic diversity of the synthesized
adversarial prompts. We propose AutoRed, a free-form adversarial prompt
generation framework that removes the need for seed instructions. AutoRed
operates in two stages: (1) persona-guided adversarial instruction generation,
and (2) a reflection loop to iteratively refine low-quality prompts. To improve
efficiency, we introduce a verifier to assess prompt harmfulness without
querying the target models. Using AutoRed, we build two red teaming datasets --
AutoRed-Medium and AutoRed-Hard -- and evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs.
AutoRed achieves higher attack success rates and better generalization than
existing baselines. Our results highlight the limitations of seed-based
approaches and demonstrate the potential of free-form red teaming for LLM
safety evaluation. We will open source our datasets in the near future.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段投票架构检测自杀意念，第一阶段用轻量BERT处理明确案例，第二阶段用LLM投票或基于心理特征的ML集成处理模糊案例，在效率和准确性上取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自杀率上升需要主动预防策略，社交媒体提供有价值信号，但检测间接表达的自杀意念（隐喻、讽刺等）仍具挑战性，现有模型要么效率低要么准确性不足。

Method: 两阶段架构：第一阶段BERT分类器处理高置信度明确案例；第二阶段模糊输入升级到多视角LLM投票框架或基于LLM提取心理特征的ML集成。

Result: 在两个数据集上表现优异：明确案例F1达98.0%，隐含案例达99.7%，跨域差距低于2%，同时显著降低LLM成本。

Conclusion: 该框架在效率和鲁棒性间取得平衡，是首批将LLM提取的心理特征作为结构化向量用于自杀风险检测的工作之一。

Abstract: Suicide rates have risen worldwide in recent years, underscoring the urgent
need for proactive prevention strategies. Social media provides valuable
signals, as many at-risk individuals - who often avoid formal help due to
stigma - choose instead to share their distress online. Yet detecting implicit
suicidal ideation, conveyed indirectly through metaphor, sarcasm, or subtle
emotional cues, remains highly challenging. Lightweight models like BERT handle
explicit signals but fail on subtle implicit ones, while large language models
(LLMs) capture nuance at prohibitive computational cost. To address this gap,
we propose a two-stage voting architecture that balances efficiency and
robustness. In Stage 1, a lightweight BERT classifier rapidly resolves
high-confidence explicit cases. In Stage 2, ambiguous inputs are escalated to
either (i) a multi-perspective LLM voting framework to maximize recall on
implicit ideation, or (ii) a feature-based ML ensemble guided by
psychologically grounded indicators extracted via prompt-engineered LLMs for
efficiency and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is among
the first works to operationalize LLM-extracted psychological features as
structured vectors for suicide risk detection. On two complementary datasets -
explicit-dominant Reddit and implicit-only DeepSuiMind - our framework
outperforms single-model baselines, achieving 98.0% F1 on explicit cases, 99.7%
on implicit ones, and reducing the cross-domain gap below 2%, while
significantly lowering LLM cost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了上下文学习(ICL)中表示形式和学习能力之间的关系，发现它们是相对独立的——标签表示决定基准准确率，而学习能力在此基础上独立提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去研究主要关注ICL中演示的表示方式对性能的影响，但对ICL的学习能力及其与表示形式的交互关系研究不足。本文旨在探究这两者是否相互独立。

Method: 开发优化算法枚举不同语义相关性的标签集，然后在不同数量演示下进行ICL实验，分析学习曲线和表示质量的关系。

Result: 发现学习确实发生且与标签集质量无关，但学习效率受标签集质量和模型参数量的共同影响。表示质量的优势在学习过程中保持稳定。

Conclusion: ICL中的表示形式和学习能力具有正交性，表示决定基准性能，学习在此基础上独立发挥作用，揭示了ICL中这两个因素的独立效应。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a large language model (LLM) to
learn a new task from a few demonstrations presented as part of the context.
Past studies have attributed a large portion of the success of ICL to the way
these in-context demonstrations are represented, particularly to how labels are
represented in classification tasks. On the other hand, observations of the
learning capacity of ICL (i.e., the extent to which more in-context
demonstrations can lead to higher performance) have been mixed, and ICL is
often thought to occur only under specific conditions. The interaction between
these two aspects in ICL, representation and learning, has not been studied in
depth until now. We hypothesize that they are largely independent of one
another, such that the representation of demonstrations determines the baseline
accuracy of ICL, while learning from additional demonstrations improves only on
top of this baseline. We validate this hypothesis by developing an optimization
algorithm that can enumerate a spectrum of possible label sets
(representations) varying in semantic relevance. We then perform ICL with
varying numbers of in-context demonstrations for each of these label sets. We
observed that learning happens regardless of the quality of the label set
itself, although its efficiency, measured by the slope of improvement over
in-context demonstrations, is conditioned on both the label set quality and the
parameter count of the underlying language model. Despite the emergence of
learning, the relative quality (accuracy) of the choice of a label set
(representation) is largely maintained throughout learning, confirming our
hypothesis and implying their orthogonality. Our work reveals a previously
underexplored aspect of ICL: the independent effects of learning from
demonstrations and their representations on ICL performance.

TL;DR: 本文研究大语言模型对条件语句可接受性的判断，发现模型对条件概率和语义相关性敏感，但与人类判断存在差异，且模型规模增大不一定更接近人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 条件可接受性在沟通和推理中很重要，但尚不清楚大语言模型如何判断条件语句的可接受性。现有研究主要关注模型的条件推理能力，而非可接受性判断。

Method: 使用线性混合效应模型和ANOVA测试，分析不同模型家族、规模和提示策略下LLMs的条件可接受性判断，并与人类数据进行对比。

Result: 模型对条件概率和语义相关性都敏感，但敏感程度因架构和提示风格而异。与人类相比，LLMs整合概率和语义线索的一致性较差，且更大模型不一定更接近人类判断。

Conclusion: LLMs能够整合条件概率和语义相关性进行条件可接受性判断，但其判断模式与人类存在系统性差异，模型规模增大不一定能改善这种差异。

Abstract: Conditional acceptability refers to how plausible a conditional statement is
perceived to be. It plays an important role in communication and reasoning, as
it influences how individuals interpret implications, assess arguments, and
make decisions based on hypothetical scenarios. When humans evaluate how
acceptable a conditional "If A, then B" is, their judgments are influenced by
two main factors: the $\textit{conditional probability}$ of $B$ given $A$, and
the $\textit{semantic relevance}$ of the antecedent $A$ given the consequent
$B$ (i.e., whether $A$ meaningfully supports $B$). While prior work has
examined how large language models (LLMs) draw inferences about conditional
statements, it remains unclear how these models judge the
$\textit{acceptability}$ of such statements. To address this gap, we present a
comprehensive study of LLMs' conditional acceptability judgments across
different model families, sizes, and prompting strategies. Using linear
mixed-effects models and ANOVA tests, we find that models are sensitive to both
conditional probability and semantic relevance-though to varying degrees
depending on architecture and prompting style. A comparison with human data
reveals that while LLMs incorporate probabilistic and semantic cues, they do so
less consistently than humans. Notably, larger models do not necessarily align
more closely with human judgments.

Motivation: 重新思考当前深度学习范式和相关的扩展定律，探索更高效的预训练架构。

Method: 使用Co⁴机器架构，具有单层、双头和8M参数，计算复杂度约为O(N)，相比传统Transformer的O(N²)复杂度更低。

Result: 在10M tokens上实现数量级更高的训练效率，在SuperGLUE任务的零样本和微调评估中，Co⁴在大多数指标上超越了GPT-2和GPT-BERT。

Conclusion: Co⁴的高效表现挑战了当前深度学习范式，表明需要重新思考模型架构设计和扩展定律。

Abstract: We show that a tiny Co$^4$ machine(Adeel,2025) with a single layer, two
heads, and 8M parameters, operating at an approximate cost of $O(N)$ (where $N$
is the number of input tokens), outpaces the BabyLM Challenge baselines GPT-2
(124M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ and GPT-BERT (30M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ in just two

greater training efficiency on 10M tokens, demonstrating highly sample
efficient pretraining. Using the BabyLM challenge evaluation pipeline across
complex benchmarks, Co$^4$ exhibits strong zero-shot and fine-tuning
performance on SuperGLUE tasks. Specifically, Co$^4$ outperforms GPT-2 on 5 out
of 7 zero-shot metrics and 6 out of 7 fine-tuning tasks, and GPT-BERT on 4 out
of 7 metrics in both cases. These results suggest the need to rethink
prevailing deep learning paradigms and associated scaling laws.

Result: ARES在多样化数学、逻辑和多模态基准测试中实现了优越的性能和推理效率，在显著降低推理成本的同时缩小了与领先商业系统的差距。

Conclusion: ARES框架通过自适应推理机制有效解决了MLRMs的推理不平衡问题，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) have
substantially improved their ability to solve complex textual and visual tasks.
However, these models tend to overthink on simple problems, producing
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning traces, while under-exploring on challenging
ones, leading to missed solutions. To address this imbalance, we propose ARES,
a unified open-source framework for adaptive reasoning that dynamically
allocates exploration effort based on task difficulty. Our approach is
motivated by two key empirical findings: (i) while single-token entropy is
noisy, high window-entropy (HWE) tokens (token-level entropies averaged under a
sliding window) can reliably capture reasoning-critical moments; and (ii)
reducing HWE usage benefits easy problems, while increasing it is essential for
solving hard ones. Building on these insights, ARES introduces a two-stage
training pipeline. In the Adaptive Cold-Start stage, we curate multimodal and
textual data paired with reasoning traces of length proportional to problem
difficulty, equipping the model with initial difficulty awareness. In the
second stage, we develop Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
uses HWE tokens as exploration triggers to decide when to explore, and a
hierarchical entropy reward with dynamic KL control to decide how much to
explore. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARES achieves superior
performance and reasoning efficiency across diverse mathematical, logical, and
multimodal benchmarks, while closing the gap to leading commercial systems
under significantly lower inference costs.

Conclusion: 这些贡献加强了LEWIDI框架，为开发分歧感知技术提供了新资源、基准和发现。

Abstract: Many researchers have reached the conclusion that AI models should be trained
to be aware of the possibility of variation and disagreement in human
judgments, and evaluated as per their ability to recognize such variation. The
LEWIDI series of shared tasks on Learning With Disagreements was established to
promote this approach to training and evaluating AI models, by making suitable
datasets more accessible and by developing evaluation methods. The third
edition of the task builds on this goal by extending the LEWIDI benchmark to
four datasets spanning paraphrase identification, irony detection, sarcasm
detection, and natural language inference, with labeling schemes that include
not only categorical judgments as in previous editions, but ordinal judgments
as well. Another novelty is that we adopt two complementary paradigms to
evaluate disagreement-aware systems: the soft-label approach, in which models
predict population-level distributions of judgments, and the perspectivist
approach, in which models predict the interpretations of individual annotators.
Crucially, we moved beyond standard metrics such as cross-entropy, and tested
new evaluation metrics for the two paradigms. The task attracted diverse
participation, and the results provide insights into the strengths and
limitations of methods to modeling variation. Together, these contributions
strengthen LEWIDI as a framework and provide new resources, benchmarks, and
findings to support the development of disagreement-aware technologies.

Motivation: 并行推理方法在生成多个思维链时会引入显著的计算冗余，分析显示超过80%的并行推理轨迹产生相同的最终答案，造成大量计算浪费。

Method: 提出DeepPrune框架，包含使用焦点损失和过采样技术训练的专业判断模型来预测答案等价性，结合在线贪心聚类算法动态剪枝冗余路径。

Conclusion: DeepPrune为高效并行推理设立了新标准，使高性能推理更加高效。

Abstract: Parallel scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance reasoning
capabilities in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces simultaneously. However, this approach introduces
significant computational inefficiency due to inter-trace redundancy -- our
analysis reveals that over 80% of parallel reasoning traces yield identical
final answers, representing substantial wasted computation. To address this
critical efficiency bottleneck, we propose DeepPrune, a novel framework that
enables efficient parallel scaling through dynamic pruning. Our method features
a specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling techniques
to accurately predict answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces which
realizes 0.87 AUROC on equivalence prediction, combined with an online greedy
clustering algorithm that dynamically prunes redundant paths while preserving
answer diversity. Comprehensive evaluations across three challenging benchmarks
(AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and GPQA) and multiple reasoning models demonstrate that
DeepPrune achieves remarkable token reduction by over 80% compared to
conventional consensus sampling on most cases, while maintaining competitive
accuracy within 3 percentage points. Our work establishes a new standard for
efficient parallel reasoning, making high-performance reasoning more efficient.

Motivation: 受人类创造新词表达新概念的启发，研究如何通过引入新词来更好地理解和控制LLM，扩展新词学习的概念。

Method: 通过添加新词嵌入并训练相关概念示例，不改变其他模型参数，使用自我描述和插件评估来验证新词含义。

Result: 新词可以控制奉承、错误答案、文本长度等概念，模型能自我描述新词含义，发现机器专用同义词，并能同时学习多个概念。

Conclusion: 新词学习是理解和控制LLM的有效方法，能揭示模型内部概念表示，为模型控制提供新途径。

Abstract: Humans invent new words when there is a rising demand for a new useful
concept (e.g., doomscrolling). We explore and validate a similar idea in our
communication with LLMs: introducing new words to better understand and control
the models, expanding on the recently introduced neologism learning. This
method introduces a new word by adding a new word embedding and training with
examples that exhibit the concept with no other changes in model parameters. We
show that adding a new word allows for control of concepts such as flattery,
incorrect answers, text length, as well as more complex concepts in AxBench. We
discover that neologisms can also further our understanding of the model via
self-verbalization: models can describe what each new word means to them in
natural language, like explaining that a word that represents a concept of
incorrect answers means ``a lack of complete, coherent, or meaningful
answers...'' To validate self-verbalizations, we introduce plug-in evaluation:
we insert the verbalization into the context of a model and measure whether it
controls the target concept. In some self-verbalizations, we find machine-only
synonyms: words that seem unrelated to humans but cause similar behavior in
machines. Finally, we show how neologism learning can jointly learn multiple
concepts in multiple words.

Abstract: Prompt optimization aims to systematically refine prompts to enhance a

Service (ToS) clauses is a challenging legal NLP task that demands carefully

propose a framework that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a proxy
prompt evaluator to more effectively explore the prompt space while reducing
evaluation costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves higher
classification accuracy and efficiency than baseline methods under a
constrained computation budget.

Method: 使用强化学习直接优化每个头的缓存使用与推理质量关系，识别推理关键头，对关键头分配完整KV缓存，对其他头应用压缩的常量KV缓存

Conclusion: RLKV通过识别推理关键头实现高效的KV缓存压缩，解决了现有方法在推理模型上的局限性

Abstract: Reasoning large language models exhibit complex reasoning behaviors through
the extended chain-of-thought generation, creating unprecedented Key-Value (KV)
cache overhead during the decoding phase. Existing KV cache compression methods
underperform on reasoning models: token-dropping methods break reasoning
integrity by discarding critical information, while head-reallocating methods
mistakenly compress reasoning-critical heads since they are designed for
retrieval tasks, resulting in significant performance degradation as
compression rates increase. We hypothesize that KV heads exhibit functional
heterogeneity in reasoning models-some heads are critical for chain-of-thought
consistency while others are compressible. To validate and exploit this
insight, we propose RLKV, a novel reasoning-critical head identification
framework, which uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize the
relationship between each head's cache usage and reasoning quality. As RLKV
produces rewards from actual generated samples during training, it naturally
identifies heads relevant to reasoning behaviors. We then allocate full KV
cache to these heads while applying compressed constant KV cache to others for
efficient inference. Our experiments reveal that only a small fraction of
attention heads is essential for reasoning, enabling our KV compression
approach to outperform baseline methods while achieving 20-50% cache reduction
with near lossless performance compared to uncompressed results.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的自我进化方法要么依赖外部奖励信号，要么从LLM自身提取内在奖励，这与人类通过相互讨论和协作进行学习进化的机制不符。

Method: CoMAS框架通过智能体间的丰富讨论动态生成内在奖励，使用LLM作为评判机制来制定这些奖励，并通过强化学习优化每个智能体的策略，实现去中心化和可扩展的协同进化。

Result: 实验结果显示CoMAS在大多数评估设置中始终优于未经训练的智能体，并达到最先进的性能。消融研究证实了基于互动的奖励信号的必要性，并显示出随着智能体数量和多样性增加的良好可扩展性。

Conclusion: CoMAS为基于LLM的智能体自我进化提供了一个新颖且有效的范式，通过多智能体协作实现了类似人类智能进化的机制。

Abstract: Self-evolution is a central research topic in enabling large language model
(LLM)-based agents to continually improve their capabilities after pretraining.
Recent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning
(RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense
external reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs
themselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution
mechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve
through mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce
Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents
to improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without
external supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion
dynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and
optimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and
scalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently
outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
most evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of
interaction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number
and diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and
effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Benchmarks are central to measuring the capabilities of large language models
and guiding model development, yet widespread data leakage from pretraining
corpora undermines their validity. Models can match memorized content rather
than demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts
cross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher,
a model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test
cases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse
pool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each
test case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original
objective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and
aggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose
shared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations
that steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply
ArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains
and show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new
failure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment,
and improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to
continuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation
models.
