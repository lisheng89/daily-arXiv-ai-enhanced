### [1] [A Novel Differential Feature Learning for Effective Hallucination Detection and Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21357)
*Wenkai Wang,Vincent Lee,Yizhen Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种双模型架构，通过投影融合块和差异特征学习机制来检测大语言模型的幻觉问题，发现幻觉信号集中在高度稀疏的特征子集中，仅需1%的特征维度即可维持检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型幻觉是一个关键挑战，现有研究虽然发现特定隐藏层在幻觉内容和事实内容之间存在差异，但幻觉信号在层内的精确定位仍不明确，限制了高效检测方法的发展。

Method: 采用双模型架构，包含投影融合块用于自适应层间特征加权，以及差异特征学习机制，通过计算并行编码器学习相同输入的互补表示之间的差异来识别判别性特征。

Result: 在HaluEval的问答、对话和摘要数据集上的系统实验表明，幻觉信号集中在高度稀疏的特征子集中，在问答和对话任务上实现了显著的准确率提升。分析揭示了分层的'漏斗模式'，浅层特征多样性高，深层特征使用集中。

Conclusion: 幻觉信号比先前假设的更加集中，这为开发计算效率高的检测系统提供了途径，可以在保持准确性的同时降低推理成本。

Abstract: Large language model hallucination represents a critical challenge where
outputs deviate from factual accuracy due to distributional biases in training
data. While recent investigations establish that specific hidden layers exhibit
differences between hallucinatory and factual content, the precise localization
of hallucination signals within layers remains unclear, limiting the
development of efficient detection methods. We propose a dual-model
architecture integrating a Projected Fusion (PF) block for adaptive inter-layer
feature weighting and a Differential Feature Learning (DFL) mechanism that
identifies discriminative features by computing differences between parallel
encoders learning complementary representations from identical inputs. Through
systematic experiments across HaluEval's question answering, dialogue, and
summarization datasets, we demonstrate that hallucination signals concentrate
in highly sparse feature subsets, achieving significant accuracy improvements
on question answering and dialogue tasks. Notably, our analysis reveals a
hierarchical "funnel pattern" where shallow layers exhibit high feature
diversity while deep layers demonstrate concentrated usage, enabling detection
performance to be maintained with minimal degradation using only 1\% of feature
dimensions. These findings suggest that hallucination signals are more
concentrated than previously assumed, offering a pathway toward computationally
efficient detection systems that could reduce inference costs while maintaining
accuracy.

### [2] [Influence Guided Context Selection for Effective Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21359)
*Jiale Deng,Yanyan Shen,Ziyuan Pei,Youmin Chen,Linpeng Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于上下文影响力值(CI值)的RAG上下文选择方法，通过量化移除每个上下文对性能的影响来评估上下文质量，无需复杂超参数调优，显著提升了RAG系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统因检索到的上下文质量差（包含不相关或噪声信息）而效果受限，传统基于预定义质量评估指标的方法无法充分利用查询、上下文列表和生成器的综合信息。

Method: 将上下文质量评估重新定义为推理时数据估值问题，引入上下文影响力值(CI值)度量，开发参数化代理模型预测CI值，采用分层架构捕获局部查询-上下文相关性和全局上下文间交互。

Result: 在8个NLP任务和多个LLM上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有最优基线，能有效过滤低质量上下文同时保留关键信息。

Conclusion: CI值方法为RAG上下文选择提供了更全面的质量评估框架，通过整合查询感知相关性、列表感知独特性和生成器感知对齐，实现了更好的性能提升。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses large language model (LLM)
hallucinations by grounding responses in external knowledge, but its
effectiveness is compromised by poor-quality retrieved contexts containing
irrelevant or noisy information. While existing approaches attempt to improve
performance through context selection based on predefined context quality
assessment metrics, they show limited gains over standard RAG. We attribute
this limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available
information (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality
assessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize
context quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and
introduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric
quantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when
removing each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware
relevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI
value eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining
contexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label
dependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate
model for CI value prediction during inference. The model employs a
hierarchical architecture that captures both local query-context relevance and
global inter-context interactions, trained through oracle CI value supervision
and end-to-end generator feedback. Extensive experiments across 8 NLP tasks and
multiple LLMs demonstrate that our context selection method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively filtering poor-quality
contexts while preserving critical information. Code is available at
https://github.com/SJTU-DMTai/RAG-CSM.

### [3] [Context Is What You Need: The Maximum Effective Context Window for Real World Limits of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21361)
*Norman Paulsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型的实际有效上下文窗口远小于宣传的最大上下文窗口，大多数模型在1000个token内就出现严重性能下降，所有模型的实际有效窗口都比宣传值小99%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试大型语言模型提供商宣传的最大上下文窗口在实际使用中的真实效果，揭示宣传值与实际有效值之间的差距。

Method: 定义了最大有效上下文窗口概念，制定了测试上下文窗口在不同大小和问题类型下有效性的方法，创建了标准化比较模型效能的方式，收集了数十万个数据点。

Result: 发现最大有效上下文窗口不仅与宣传的最大上下文窗口差异巨大，而且根据问题类型而变化。一些顶级模型在仅100个token时就失败，大多数模型在1000个token内准确率严重下降。

Conclusion: 最大有效上下文窗口根据问题类型而变化，这为如何提高模型准确率和减少幻觉率提供了清晰可行的见解。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) providers boast big numbers for maximum context
window sizes. To test the real world use of context windows, we 1) define a
concept of maximum effective context window, 2) formulate a testing method of a
context window's effectiveness over various sizes and problem types, and 3)
create a standardized way to compare model efficacy for increasingly larger
context window sizes to find the point of failure. We collected hundreds of
thousands of data points across several models and found significant
differences between reported Maximum Context Window (MCW) size and Maximum
Effective Context Window (MECW) size. Our findings show that the MECW is, not
only, drastically different from the MCW but also shifts based on the problem
type. A few top of the line models in our test group failed with as little as
100 tokens in context; most had severe degradation in accuracy by 1000 tokens
in context. All models fell far short of their Maximum Context Window by as
much as 99 percent. Our data reveals the Maximum Effective Context Window
shifts based on the type of problem provided, offering clear and actionable
insights into how to improve model accuracy and decrease model hallucination
rates.

### [4] [How Large Language Models Need Symbolism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21404)
*Xiaotie Deng,Hanyu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI发展需要超越单纯规模扩展，通过人类构建的符号作为指南针来引导大型语言模型的直觉能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI发展过度依赖规模扩展，缺乏真正的发现能力，需要引入人类符号来引导模型的直觉

Method: 提出使用人类构建的符号作为指南针来引导大型语言模型的直觉能力

Result: 该方法旨在解锁真正的发现能力，使AI能够进行更有意义的探索

Conclusion: AI的未来发展需要结合人类符号指导与模型直觉能力，而不仅仅是规模扩展

Abstract: We argue that AI's future requires more than scaling. To unlock genuine
discovery, large language models need a compass: human-crafted symbols to guide
their powerful but blind intuition.

### [5] [One Model, Many Morals: Uncovering Cross-Linguistic Misalignments in Computational Moral Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21443)
*Sualeha Farid,Jayden Lin,Zean Chen,Shivani Kumar,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在跨语言道德推理中存在显著不一致性，反映了文化错位问题，需要更具文化意识的AI系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs主要基于英语数据训练，但在多语言和多文化环境中部署时，其道德推理能力是否能跨语言和文化泛化存在关键担忧。

Method: 将两个成熟的道德推理基准翻译成五种文化和类型学上不同的语言，进行多语言零样本评估，通过精心构建的研究问题分析差异驱动因素。

Result: 发现LLMs在不同语言间的道德判断存在显著不一致，往往反映文化错位，并揭示了从分歧到推理策略的潜在驱动因素。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一个结构化的道德推理错误类型学，呼吁开发更具文化意识的AI系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual and
multicultural environments where moral reasoning is essential for generating
ethically appropriate responses. Yet, the dominant pretraining of LLMs on
English-language data raises critical concerns about their ability to
generalize judgments across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. In this
work, we systematically investigate how language mediates moral decision-making
in LLMs. We translate two established moral reasoning benchmarks into five
culturally and typologically diverse languages, enabling multilingual zero-shot
evaluation. Our analysis reveals significant inconsistencies in LLMs' moral
judgments across languages, often reflecting cultural misalignment. Through a
combination of carefully constructed research questions, we uncover the
underlying drivers of these disparities, ranging from disagreements to
reasoning strategies employed by LLMs. Finally, through a case study, we link
the role of pretraining data in shaping an LLM's moral compass. Through this
work, we distill our insights into a structured typology of moral reasoning
errors that calls for more culturally-aware AI.

### [6] [LLM-Based Support for Diabetes Diagnosis: Opportunities, Scenarios, and Challenges with GPT-5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21450)
*Gaurav Kumar Gupta,Nirajan Acharya,Pranal Pande*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估GPT-5在糖尿病诊断和管理中的表现，使用基于ADA 2025标准的合成病例框架，测试了症状识别、实验室解读、妊娠糖尿病筛查、远程监测和多模态并发症检测五个场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病是全球重大健康挑战，影响超过5亿成年人且患病率持续上升。尽管ADA提供明确诊断标准，但由于症状模糊、实验室值临界、妊娠期复杂性及长期监测需求，早期识别仍很困难。LLM的进展为通过结构化、可解释和患者友好的输出来增强决策支持提供了机会。

Method: 使用完全基于合成病例的模拟框架，这些病例与ADA 2025护理标准一致，并受NHANES、Pima Indians、EyePACS和MIMIC-IV等公共数据集启发。测试了五个代表性场景：症状识别、实验室解读、妊娠糖尿病筛查、远程监测和多模态并发症检测。GPT-5对病例进行分类、生成临床推理、提供患者解释并输出结构化JSON摘要。

Result: 结果显示与ADA定义的标准高度一致，表明GPT-5可能作为临床医生和患者的双重用途工具。

Conclusion: GPT-5在糖尿病诊断和管理中表现出与ADA标准的高度一致性，强调了可重复评估框架在负责任评估医疗领域LLM的重要性。

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is a major global health challenge, affecting over half a
billion adults worldwide with prevalence projected to rise. Although the
American Diabetes Association (ADA) provides clear diagnostic thresholds, early
recognition remains difficult due to vague symptoms, borderline laboratory
values, gestational complexity, and the demands of long-term monitoring.
Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to enhance
decision support through structured, interpretable, and patient-friendly
outputs. This study evaluates GPT-5, the latest generative pre-trained
transformer, using a simulation framework built entirely on synthetic cases
aligned with ADA Standards of Care 2025 and inspired by public datasets
including NHANES, Pima Indians, EyePACS, and MIMIC-IV. Five representative
scenarios were tested: symptom recognition, laboratory interpretation,
gestational diabetes screening, remote monitoring, and multimodal complication
detection. For each, GPT-5 classified cases, generated clinical rationales,
produced patient explanations, and output structured JSON summaries. Results
showed strong alignment with ADA-defined criteria, suggesting GPT-5 may
function as a dual-purpose tool for clinicians and patients, while underscoring
the importance of reproducible evaluation frameworks for responsibly assessing
LLMs in healthcare.

### [7] [Diagnosing the Performance Trade-off in Moral Alignment: A Case Study on Gender Stereotypes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21456)
*Guangliang Liu,Bocheng Chen,Xitong Zhang,Kristen Marie Johnson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了在减轻语言模型性别刻板印象时，性能权衡的机制，发现当前公平性目标在实现权衡方面存在局限，下游任务性能主要由整体遗忘水平驱动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究道德对齐过程中性能权衡的底层机制，特别是在减轻性别刻板印象的背景下，通过遗忘和公平性目标的视角来分析。

Method: 通过分析遗忘和公平性目标，研究选择性遗忘刻板印象如何影响整体遗忘水平和下游任务性能。

Result: 分析表明：(1)下游任务性能主要由整体遗忘水平驱动；(2)选择性遗忘刻板印象会增加整体遗忘；(3)减轻遗忘的通用解决方案对减少整体遗忘无效，无法改善下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 当前公平性目标在实现性能权衡方面存在局限性，需要更有效的方法来平衡道德对齐和任务性能。

Abstract: Moral alignment has emerged as a widely adopted approach for regulating the
behavior of pretrained language models (PLMs), typically through fine-tuning or
model editing on curated datasets. However, this process often comes at the
cost of degraded downstream task performance. Prior studies commonly aim to
achieve a performance trade-off by encouraging PLMs to selectively forget
stereotypical knowledge through carefully designed fairness objectives, while
preserving their helpfulness. In this short paper, we investigate the
underlying mechanisms of the performance trade-off in the context of mitigating
gender stereotypes, through the lens of forgetting and the fairness objective.
Our analysis reveals the limitations of current fairness objective in achieving
trade-off by demonstrating that: (1) downstream task performance is primarily
driven by the overall forgetting level; (2) selective forgetting of stereotypes
tends to increase overall forgetting; and (3) general solutions for mitigating
forgetting are ineffective at reducing overall forgetting and fail to improve
downstream task performance.

### [8] [A State-of-the-Art SQL Reasoning Model using RLVR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21459)
*Alnur Ali,Ashutosh Baheti,Jonathan Chang,Ta-Chung Chi,Brandon Cui,Andrew Drozdov,Jonathan Frankle,Abhay Gupta,Pallavi Koppol,Sean Kulinski,Jonathan Li,Dipendra Misra,Krista Opsahl-Ong,Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz,Matei Zaharia,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于可验证奖励强化学习（RLVR）的框架，用于开发能够整合组织特定知识的自定义推理模型。该框架应用于BIRD数据科学基准测试，通过精心设计的提示和模型选择、离线RL预热阶段（TAO）以及严格的在线RLVR训练，在BIRD排行榜上实现了最先进的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够整合组织特定知识的自定义推理模型具有巨大潜力，可以解决企业客户面临的问题。许多这类问题的奖励函数是可验证的，即RLVR设置。

Method: 采用简单通用的训练配方：精心设计的提示和模型选择、使用离线RL方法TAO进行预热阶段、严格的在线RLVR训练。仅使用BIRD训练集，未使用专有模型。

Result: 在BIRD排行榜上首次提交即达到最先进水平：无自一致性时准确率73.56%，有自一致性时准确率75.68%。在后一种情况下，模型所需的生成次数少于第二名方法。

Conclusion: 虽然BIRD只是一个代理任务，但该框架的简单性使其广泛适用于企业领域，如商业智能、数据科学和编程。

Abstract: Developing custom reasoning models via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that can
incorporate organization-specific knowledge has great potential to address
problems faced by enterprise customers. In many of these problems, the reward
function is verifiable, a setting termed RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We
apply RLVR to a popular data science benchmark called BIRD that measures the
ability of an AI agent to convert a natural language query for a database to
SQL executions. We apply a simple and general-purpose training recipe involving
careful prompt and model selection, a warm-up stage using our offline RL
approach called TAO, followed by rigorous online RLVR training. With no
additional training data beyond the BIRD training set and no use of proprietary
models, our very first submission to the BIRD leaderboard reached
state-of-the-art accuracy on the private test set: 73.56% without
self-consistency and 75.68% with self-consistency. In the latter case, our
model also required fewer generations than the second-best approach. While BIRD
is only a proxy task, the simplicity of our framework makes it broadly
applicable to enterprise domains such as business intelligence, data science,
and coding.

### [9] [Learning to Reason with Mixture of Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21482)
*Adit Jain,Brendan Rappazzo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出在强化学习可验证奖励（RLVR）中使用混合token生成（MoT-G）方法，通过保留模型在候选token上的概率分布信息，显著提升了推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法在推理步骤中采样离散token，丢弃了模型概率分布中的丰富分布信息，这限制了推理搜索空间。

Method: 提出了一个统一的MoT-G框架，将RLVR扩展到连续混合空间中操作，包括构建混合嵌入作为token嵌入的加权和，以及在该空间中生成思维链。

Result: 在Reasoning-Gym推理任务套件上，MoT-G方法相比标准解码实现了显著改进（7/10任务提升5-35%），同时用一半轨迹数达到可比精度。

Conclusion: MoT-G通过保持更高的隐藏状态熵和促进token空间探索来提升推理性能，证明了保留分布信息在RLVR中的重要性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a leading
approach for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities. Most
current methods follow variants of Group Relative Policy Optimization, which
samples multiple reasoning completions, scores them relative to each other, and
adjusts the policy accordingly. However, these approaches invariably sample
discrete tokens at each reasoning step, discarding the rich distributional
information in the model's probability distribution over candidate tokens.
While preserving and utilizing this distributional information has proven
beneficial in non-RL settings, current RLVR methods seem to be unnecessarily
constraining the reasoning search space by not using this information. To
address this limitation, we investigate mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in
RLVR. We present a unified framework that generalizes existing MoT-G
approaches, including existing training-free methods that construct mixture
embeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings, and extend RLVR to operate
directly in this continuous mixture space for generating chain-of-thought.
Evaluating two MoT-G variants on Reasoning-Gym, a suite of reasoning-intensive
language tasks, we find that MoT--G methods achieve substantial improvements
(5--35 \% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) compared to standard decoding with the
Qwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of
trajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency. Through comprehensive
hidden-state and token-level analyses, we provide evidence that MoT--G's
benefits may stem from its ability to maintain higher hidden-state entropy
throughout the reasoning process and promote exploration in token space.

### [10] [Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation: Improving Classifier Accuracy with Train-Time-Only Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21487)
*Jillian Xu,Dylan Zhou,Vinay Shukla,Yang Yang,Junrui Ruan,Shuhuai Lin,Wenfei Zou,Yinxiao Liu,Karthik Lakshmanan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation (DHRD)方法，通过添加分类头和推理头，在训练时利用教师模型的推理过程进行监督，在推理时只使用分类头，实现了准确率提升和推理速度的显著优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Chain-of-Thought (CoT)提示在提升分类准确率的同时带来的推理速度显著下降问题，需要在准确率和吞吐量之间找到平衡。

Method: 为仅解码器语言模型添加两个头：(i) 池化分类头，在训练和推理时使用；(ii) 推理头，仅在训练时使用教师模型的推理过程进行监督。使用标签交叉熵和输入加推理序列的token级语言模型损失的加权和作为损失函数。

Result: 在七个SuperGLUE任务上，DHRD相比池化基线获得0.65-5.47%的相对提升，在蕴含/因果任务上提升更明显。推理时禁用推理头，推理吞吐量与池化分类器相当，比相同骨干网络的CoT解码快96-142倍。

Conclusion: DHRD方法成功解决了CoT提示的准确率-吞吐量权衡问题，在保持推理效率的同时显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting often improves classification accuracy, but
it introduces a significant throughput penalty with rationale generation (Wei
et al., 2022; Cheng and Van Durme, 2024). To resolve this trade-off, we
introduce Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation (DHRD), a simple training method for
decoder-only language models (LMs) that adds (i) a pooled classification head
used during training and inference and (ii) a reasoning head supervised by
teacher rationales used only in training. We train with a loss function that is
a weighted sum of label cross-entropy and token-level LM loss over
input-plus-rationale sequences. On seven SuperGLUE tasks, DHRD yields relative
gains of 0.65-5.47% over pooled baselines, with notably larger gains on
entailment/causal tasks. Since we disable the reasoning head at test time,
inference throughput matches pooled classifiers and exceeds CoT decoding on the
same backbones by 96-142 times in QPS.

### [11] [On Code-Induced Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21499)
*Abdul Waheed,Zhen Wu,Carolyn Rosé,Daphne Ippolito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过系统实验发现，代码的结构特性比语义特性对LLM推理能力更重要，适当的抽象（如伪代码）可以替代代码，而保持表面规律性的损坏代码仍具竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究代码数据中哪些方面对提升大语言模型推理能力最为关键，理解代码不同属性如何影响模型推理。

Method: 构建十种编程语言的并行指令数据集，应用受控扰动选择性破坏代码的结构或语义属性，在五个模型家族和八个规模上微调LLMs，评估其在自然语言、数学和代码任务上的表现。

Result: 在3,331次实验中，LLMs对结构扰动比语义扰动更敏感，特别是在数学和代码任务上。伪代码和流程图等抽象与代码效果相当，但使用更少token。保持表面规律性的损坏代码仍具竞争力。不同编程语言对特定任务有优势。

Conclusion: 代码的结构特性是提升LLM推理能力的关键因素，适当的抽象可以替代代码，表面规律性比严格语法更重要，这为设计训练数据以增强LLM推理能力提供了指导。

Abstract: Code data has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but it remains unclear which aspects of code are most
responsible. We investigate this question with a systematic, data-centric
framework. We construct parallel instruction datasets in ten programming
languages and apply controlled perturbations that selectively disrupt
structural or semantic properties of code. We then finetune LLMs from five
model families and eight scales on each variant and evaluate their performance
on natural language, math, and code tasks. Across 3,331 experiments, our
results show that LLMs are more vulnerable to structural perturbations than
semantic ones, particularly on math and code tasks. Appropriate abstractions
like pseudocode and flowcharts can be as effective as code, while encoding the
same information with fewer tokens without adhering to original syntax can
often retain or even improve performance. Remarkably, even corrupted code with
misleading signals remains competitive when surface-level regularities persist.
Finally, syntactic styles also shape task-specific gains with Python favoring
natural language reasoning and lower-level languages such as Java and Rust
favoring math. Through our systematic framework, we aim to provide insight into
how different properties of code influence reasoning and inform the design of
training data for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发基于Kisan呼叫中心数据的农业聊天机器人，帮助农民获取天气、市场价格、植物保护和政府计划等信息，准确率从56%提升到86%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度是农业经济国家，农民需要便捷获取农业实践信息以实现最优农业增长和产出。

Method: 基于句子嵌入模型构建农业聊天机器人，通过消除同义词和整合实体提取来提高准确性。

Result: 系统准确率从56%提升到86%，可24/7通过任何电子设备访问，为农民提供易于理解的农业信息。

Conclusion: 该系统能帮助农民更容易获取农业实践信息，提高农业产出，同时减轻呼叫中心工作负担，使人力资源得到更好利用。

Abstract: India is an agro-based economy and proper information about agricultural
practices is the key to optimal agricultural growth and output. In order to
answer the queries of the farmer, we have build an agricultural chatbot based
on the dataset from Kisan Call Center. This system is robust enough to answer
queries related to weather, market rates, plant protection and government
schemes. This system is available 24* 7, can be accessed through any electronic
device and the information is delivered with the ease of understanding. The
system is based on a sentence embedding model which gives an accuracy of 56%.
After eliminating synonyms and incorporating entity extraction, the accuracy
jumps to 86%. With such a system, farmers can progress towards easier
information about farming related practices and hence a better agricultural
output. The job of the Call Center workforce would be made easier and the hard
work of various such workers can be redirected to a better goal.

*Chibuzor Okocha,Kelechi Ezema,Christan Grant*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了非洲口音英语在说话人日志任务中的领域效应，发现临床对话存在显著的领域惩罚，并通过轻量级领域适应方法部分缓解了这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是考察说话人日志系统在不同领域（通用对话vs临床对话）对非洲口音英语的表现差异，特别关注临床对话中的领域效应。

Method: 评估了多个生产和开源系统在严格DER协议下的表现，使用错误分解和对话级分析，并测试了在口音匹配数据上微调分割模块的轻量级领域适应方法。

Result: 临床语音存在一致的领域惩罚，主要归因于误报和漏检错误，与短轮次和频繁重叠相关。领域适应方法减少了错误但未能完全消除差距。

Conclusion: 研究指出重叠感知分割和平衡的临床资源是实用的后续步骤，并提供了跨领域基准、错误分解方法和易于复现的适应方案。

Abstract: This study examines domain effects in speaker diarization for
African-accented English. We evaluate multiple production and open systems on
general and clinical dialogues under a strict DER protocol that scores overlap.
A consistent domain penalty appears for clinical speech and remains significant
across models. Error analysis attributes much of this penalty to false alarms
and missed detections, aligning with short turns and frequent overlap. We test
lightweight domain adaptation by fine-tuning a segmentation module on
accent-matched data; it reduces error but does not eliminate the gap. Our
contributions include a controlled benchmark across domains, a concise approach
to error decomposition and conversation-level profiling, and an adaptation
recipe that is easy to reproduce. Results point to overlap-aware segmentation
and balanced clinical resources as practical next steps.

*Yash Saxena,Raviteja Bommireddy,Ankur Padia,Manas Gaur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了两种LLM引用范式：生成时引用(G-Cite)和后处理引用(P-Cite)，发现检索是影响归因质量的主要因素，建议高风险应用优先采用检索中心的P-Cite方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域如医疗、法律等，可信赖的LLM必须提供可验证的引用来源，但实践中存在生成时引用还是后处理引用的选择问题。

Method: 在四个流行归因数据集上，从零样本到高级检索增强方法进行全面评估，比较G-Cite和P-Cite两种范式。

Result: 结果显示覆盖率和引用正确性之间存在权衡，检索是归因质量的主要驱动因素。P-Cite方法实现高覆盖率且具有竞争力的正确性，G-Cite方法优先考虑精度但牺牲覆盖率和速度。

Conclusion: 推荐高风险应用采用检索中心的P-Cite优先方法，对于严格声明验证等精度关键场景保留G-Cite方法。

Abstract: Trustworthy Large Language Models (LLMs) must cite human-verifiable sources
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, academia, and finance, where
even small errors can have severe consequences. Practitioners and researchers
face a choice: let models generate citations during decoding, or let models
draft answers first and then attach appropriate citations. To clarify this
choice, we introduce two paradigms: Generation-Time Citation (G-Cite), which
produces the answer and citations in one pass, and Post-hoc Citation (P-Cite),
which adds or verifies citations after drafting. We conduct a comprehensive
evaluation from zero-shot to advanced retrieval-augmented methods across four
popular attribution datasets and provide evidence-based recommendations that
weigh trade-offs across use cases. Our results show a consistent trade-off
between coverage and citation correctness, with retrieval as the main driver of
attribution quality in both paradigms. P-Cite methods achieve high coverage
with competitive correctness and moderate latency, whereas G-Cite methods
prioritize precision at the cost of coverage and speed. We recommend a
retrieval-centric, P-Cite-first approach for high-stakes applications,
reserving G-Cite for precision-critical settings such as strict claim
verification. Our codes and human evaluation results are available at

TL;DR: ComPSum是一个个性化多文档摘要框架，通过比较用户偏好与其他用户偏好的细粒度差异来生成个性化摘要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化多文档摘要需要满足用户对写作风格和内容焦点的个性化偏好，而识别用户偏好的细粒度差异是实现有效个性化的关键。

Method: ComPSum首先通过比较给定用户偏好与其他用户偏好来生成结构化分析，然后使用该分析指导个性化摘要的生成。

Result: 在PerMSum数据集上使用AuthorMap评估框架进行评估，ComPSum优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过比较用户偏好的细粒度差异来生成结构化分析，可以有效指导个性化摘要的生成，提升个性化效果。

Abstract: Personalized multi-document summarization (MDS) is essential for meeting
individual user preferences of writing style and content focus for summaries.
In this paper, we propose that for effective personalization, it is important
to identify fine-grained differences between users' preferences by comparing
the given user's preferences with other users' preferences.Motivated by this,
we propose ComPSum, a personalized MDS framework. It first generates a
structured analysis of a user by comparing their preferences with other users'
preferences. The generated structured analysis is then used to guide the
generation of personalized summaries. To evaluate the performance of ComPSum,
we propose AuthorMap, a fine-grained reference-free evaluation framework for
personalized MDS. It evaluates the personalization of a system based on the
authorship attribution between two personalized summaries generated for
different users. For robust evaluation of personalized MDS, we construct
PerMSum, a personalized MDS dataset in the review and news domain. We evaluate
the performance of ComPSum on PerMSum using AuthorMap, showing that it
outperforms strong baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出五种VLM作为形式化器的管道，用于解决一次性、开放词汇和多模态PDDL形式化问题，在真实、多视角、低质量图像的规划任务中显著优于端到端规划生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在简单多模态规划任务中表现良好，但在需要长序列动作的长视野规划任务中表现不足。文本领域通过将规划问题转换为形式化规划语言（如PDDL）已取得显著改进，但在多模态环境中相关研究仍然稀缺。

Method: 开发了五种VLM作为形式化器的管道，能够处理一次性、开放词汇和多模态PDDL形式化。在现有基准测试基础上，提出了两个新的基准测试，首次考虑使用真实、多视角和低质量图像进行规划。

Result: VLM作为形式化器在性能上大大优于端到端规划生成。研究发现瓶颈在于视觉而非语言，因为VLM经常无法捕捉必要的对象关系的完整集合。生成中间文本表示（如标题或场景图）可以部分补偿性能，但其增益不一致。

Conclusion: VLM作为形式化器在多模态规划中具有显著优势，但视觉能力仍然是主要瓶颈。中间文本表示提供了部分改进，但性能提升不一致，为未来多模态规划形式化研究留下了发展空间。

Abstract: The advancement of vision language models (VLMs) has empowered embodied
agents to accomplish simple multimodal planning tasks, but not long-horizon
ones requiring long sequences of actions. In text-only simulations,
long-horizon planning has seen significant improvement brought by repositioning
the role of LLMs. Instead of directly generating action sequences, LLMs
translate the planning domain and problem into a formal planning language like
the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), which can call a formal solver
to derive the plan in a verifiable manner. In multimodal environments, research
on VLM-as-formalizer remains scarce, usually involving gross simplifications
such as predefined object vocabulary or overly similar few-shot examples. In
this work, we present a suite of five VLM-as-formalizer pipelines that tackle
one-shot, open-vocabulary, and multimodal PDDL formalization. We evaluate those
on an existing benchmark while presenting another two that for the first time
account for planning with authentic, multi-view, and low-quality images. We
conclude that VLM-as-formalizer greatly outperforms end-to-end plan generation.
We reveal the bottleneck to be vision rather than language, as VLMs often fail
to capture an exhaustive set of necessary object relations. While generating
intermediate, textual representations such as captions or scene graphs
partially compensate for the performance, their inconsistent gain leaves
headroom for future research directions on multimodal planning formalization.

### [17] ["Be My Cheese?": Assessing Cultural Nuance in Multilingual LLM Translations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21577)
*Madison Van Doren,Cory Holland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了多语言AI模型在翻译比喻性语言时的本地化能力，发现尽管语法正确，但文化适应性仍是主要挑战，特别是对于习语和双关语的翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM翻译研究和行业基准主要关注语法准确性和词级正确性，而忽略了文化适应性和整体本地化质量，这对于营销和电子商务等实际应用至关重要。

Method: 评估了87个LLM生成的电子商务营销邮件翻译，涵盖20种语言的24种区域方言，由母语评审员提供定量评分和定性反馈。

Result: 领先模型通常能产生语法正确的翻译，但在文化细微语言方面仍有明显改进空间，经常需要大量人工修正。即使是高资源全球语言也经常误译比喻性表达和文字游戏。

Conclusion: 挑战了数据量是机器翻译质量最可靠预测因子的假设，引入文化适应性作为多语言LLM性能的关键决定因素，强调需要更大规模的研究来为文化多样化环境中的可靠机器翻译工作流程提供指导。

Abstract: This pilot study explores the localisation capabilities of state-of-the-art
multilingual AI models when translating figurative language, such as idioms and
puns, from English into a diverse range of global languages. It expands on
existing LLM translation research and industry benchmarks, which emphasise
grammatical accuracy and token-level correctness, by focusing on cultural
appropriateness and overall localisation quality - critical factors for
real-world applications like marketing and e-commerce.
  To investigate these challenges, this project evaluated a sample of 87
LLM-generated translations of e-commerce marketing emails across 24 regional
dialects of 20 languages. Human reviewers fluent in each target language
provided quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on faithfulness to the
original's tone, meaning, and intended audience. Findings suggest that, while
leading models generally produce grammatically correct translations, culturally
nuanced language remains a clear area for improvement, often requiring
substantial human refinement. Notably, even high-resource global languages,
despite topping industry benchmark leaderboards, frequently mistranslated
figurative expressions and wordplay.
  This work challenges the assumption that data volume is the most reliable
predictor of machine translation quality and introduces cultural
appropriateness as a key determinant of multilingual LLM performance - an area
currently underexplored in existing academic and industry benchmarks. As a
proof of concept, this pilot highlights limitations of current multilingual AI
systems for real-world localisation use cases. Results of this pilot support
the opportunity for expanded research at greater scale to deliver generalisable
insights and inform deployment of reliable machine translation workflows in
culturally diverse contexts.

meta-policy MORL development that can improve efficiency and flexibility
through its bi-level learning paradigm, highlighting key research questions and
potential solutions for improving LLM performance.

*Yuxuan Zhu,David H. Yang,Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri,Keerthiram Murugesan,Tejaswini Pedapati,Pin-Yu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OjaKV是一个KV缓存压缩框架，通过混合存储策略和在线子空间自适应来减少长上下文推理的内存瓶颈，无需模型微调即可保持或提升零样本准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型长上下文推理中的KV缓存内存瓶颈问题，现有静态压缩方法在数据分布变化时性能不佳。

Method: 采用混合存储策略：完整保留首尾关键token作为锚点，对中间token使用基于Oja算法的在线PCA进行低秩压缩，在预填充阶段全面更新，解码阶段轻量级周期性更新。

Result: 在高压缩比下保持或提升零样本准确率，在需要复杂推理的超长上下文基准测试中表现最佳，证明了在线子空间自适应对动态跟踪上下文变化的重要性。

Conclusion: OjaKV提供了一个实用、即插即用的内存高效长上下文推理解决方案，完全兼容现代注意力模块如FlashAttention。

Abstract: The expanding long-context capabilities of large language models are
constrained by a significant memory bottleneck: the key-value (KV) cache
required for autoregressive generation. This bottleneck is substantial; for
instance, a Llama-3.1-8B model processing a 32K-token prompt at a batch size of
4 requires approximately 16GB for its KV cache, a size exceeding the model's
weights. While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising
direction, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that
performs poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid
storage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that
not all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial
first and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors
for attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies
low-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's
algorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a
comprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates
during decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving
context. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention
modules like FlashAttention. Experiments demonstrate that OjaKV maintains or
even improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios. In particular,
OjaKV achieves its strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks that require
complex reasoning, highlighting the importance of online subspace adaptation in
dynamically tracking context shifts. These results establish our hybrid
framework as a practical, plug-and-play solution for memory-efficient
long-context inference without requiring model fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 该论文是一篇关于语言模型可解释人工智能(XAI)技术的综述，特别关注不同Transformer架构下的XAI方法，并通过合理性和忠实性两个维度评估这些技术。


<details>

Motivation: 语言模型的黑盒特性在关键领域应用中带来了透明度问题，而现有的XAI方法在应用于语言模型时面临诸多限制，现有综述未能充分捕捉语言模型架构多样性和能力演变带来的独特挑战。

Method: 根据Transformer架构类型（仅编码器、仅解码器、编码器-解码器）对XAI技术进行系统分类，分析每种架构下方法的适配情况，并通过合理性和忠实性两个维度评估技术效果。

Result: 提供了针对不同Transformer架构的XAI技术全面综述，识别了各种方法的优势和局限性，为开发更鲁棒、透明的XAI方法提供了结构化视角。

Conclusion: 识别了开放的研究挑战并指出了有前景的未来方向，旨在指导开发针对语言模型的鲁棒、透明和可解释的XAI方法。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing
and enabled remarkable progress across diverse domains, yet their black-box
nature raises critical concerns about the interpretability of their internal
mechanisms and decision-making processes. This lack of transparency is
particularly problematic for adoption in high-stakes domains, where
stakeholders need to understand the rationale behind model outputs to ensure
accountability. On the other hand, while explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) methods have been well studied for non-LMs, they face many limitations
when applied to LMs due to their complex architectures, considerable training
corpora, and broad generalization abilities. Although various surveys have
examined XAI in the context of LMs, they often fail to capture the distinct
challenges arising from the architectural diversity and evolving capabilities
of these models. To bridge this gap, this survey presents a comprehensive
review of XAI techniques with a particular emphasis on LMs, organizing them
according to their underlying transformer architectures: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder, and analyzing how methods are adapted to
each while assessing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore,
we evaluate these techniques through the dual lenses of plausibility and
faithfulness, offering a structured perspective on their effectiveness.
Finally, we identify open research challenges and outline promising future
directions, aiming to guide ongoing efforts toward the development of robust,
transparent, and interpretable XAI methods for LMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI会议投稿量激增，同行评审质量下降，需要可靠检测低质量评审的方法。

Method: 定义错误信息评审点，构建ReviewScore数据集，提出自动化引擎重构弱点前提，使用8个先进LLMs评估人类-模型一致性。

Result: 15.2%的弱点和26.4%的问题存在错误信息，LLMs在ReviewScore评估上达到中等一致性，前提级事实性评估比弱点级评估一致性更高。

Conclusion: 自动化ReviewScore评估具有潜力，前提级事实性评估是更可靠的方法。

Abstract: Peer review serves as a backbone of academic research, but in most AI
conferences, the review quality is degrading as the number of submissions
explodes. To reliably detect low-quality reviews, we define misinformed review
points as either "weaknesses" in a review that contain incorrect premises, or
"questions" in a review that can be already answered by the paper. We verify
that 15.2% of weaknesses and 26.4% of questions are misinformed and introduce
ReviewScore indicating if a review point is misinformed. To evaluate the
factuality of each premise of weaknesses, we propose an automated engine that
reconstructs every explicit and implicit premise from a weakness. We build a
human expert-annotated ReviewScore dataset to check the ability of LLMs to
automate ReviewScore evaluation. Then, we measure human-model agreements on
ReviewScore using eight current state-of-the-art LLMs and verify moderate
agreements. We also prove that evaluating premise-level factuality shows
significantly higher agreements than evaluating weakness-level factuality. A
thorough disagreement analysis further supports a potential of fully automated
ReviewScore evaluation.

this task. We present GRAB, a finance-specific benchmark with 1.61M sentences
from 8,247 filings and span-grounded sentence labels produced without manual

TL;DR: ToG-3提出了一个新颖的检索增强生成框架，通过多智能体上下文演化和检索机制，动态构建和优化异构图索引，解决了传统图RAG方法中静态图构建的局限性。


<details>

Conclusion: ToG-3通过双重演化的多智能体系统，能够在推理过程中自适应地构建目标图索引，减轻了静态一次性图构建的固有缺点，即使使用轻量级LLM也能实现深度精确的推理。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Graph-based RAG has become the
important paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external
knowledge. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While
graph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures,
they face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge
graphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted
graphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM
extractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper
presents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces
Multi-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these
limitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of
a Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly
incorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving
Sub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical
limitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static
graph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A
multi-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser
agents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval,
answer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and
subgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively
build a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent
drawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise
reasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning
benchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of
MACER framework.

Result: 在32个不同个性用户的实验中，ProPerAssistant能够调整策略并稳步提升用户满意度。

Conclusion: 结合主动性和个性化具有良好前景，ProPerSim框架和ProPerAssistant系统为开发更智能的AI助手提供了有效途径。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily
life, there is growing demand for AI assistants that are not only reactive but
also proactive and personalized. While recent advances have pushed forward
proactivity and personalization individually, their combination remains
underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProPerSim, a new task and
simulation framework for developing assistants capable of making timely,
personalized recommendations in realistic home scenarios. In our simulation
environment, a user agent with a rich persona interacts with the assistant,
providing ratings on how well each suggestion aligns with its preferences and
context. The assistant's goal is to use these ratings to learn and adapt to
achieve higher scores over time. Built on ProPerSim, we propose
ProPerAssistant, a retrieval-augmented, preference-aligned assistant that
continually learns and adapts through user feedback. Experiments across 32
diverse personas show that ProPerAssistant adapts its strategy and steadily
improves user satisfaction, highlighting the promise of uniting proactivity and
personalization.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for question answering (QA) over
lengthy contexts is a significant challenge. In industrial settings, this
process is often hindered by high computational costs and latency, especially
when multiple questions must be answered based on the same context. In this
work, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to answer multiple questions based on
the same conversational context. We conduct extensive experiments and benchmark
a range of both proprietary and public models on this challenging task. Our
findings highlight that while strong proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o achieve the
best overall performance, fine-tuned public LLMs with up to 8 billion
parameters can surpass GPT-4o in accuracy, which demonstrates their potential
for transparent and cost-effective deployment in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自推测偏置解码方法，用于加速流式应用中的同时翻译，无需草稿计算即可实现1.7倍加速，并减少80%的闪烁问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在流式应用（如实时翻译）中面临挑战，需要持续更新输出以应对不断扩展的输入上下文，同时保持合理的计算成本以满足延迟要求。

Method: 使用最近输出作为当前增长输入上下文的草稿，在验证阶段偏向草稿标记以提高接受率，无需重复从头生成输出。

Conclusion: 该方法无需草稿计算，是模型无关的即插即用解决方案，适用于加速延迟敏感的流式应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive
capabilities in various text generation tasks. However, it remains challenging
to use them off-the-shelf in streaming applications (such as live translation),
where the output must continually update as the input context expands, while
still maintaining a reasonable computational cost to meet the latency
requirement.
  In this work, we reexamine the re-translation approach to simultaneous
translation and propose Self-Speculative Biased Decoding, a novel inference
paradigm designed to avoid repeatedly generating output from scratch for a
consistently growing input stream. We propose using the most recent output as a
draft for the current growing input context. During the verification stage, the
output will be biased towards the draft token for a higher draft acceptance
rate. This strategy not only minimizes flickering that might distract users but
also leads to higher speedups. Conventional decoding may take charge from the
point of divergence after draft verification and continue until the end
condition is met.
  Unlike existing speculative decoding strategies, our approach eliminates the
need for draft computations, making it a model-agnostic and plug-and-play
solution for accelerating latency-sensitive streaming applications.
Experimental results on simultaneous text-to-text re-translation demonstrate
that our approach achieves up to 1.7x speedup compared to conventional
auto-regressive re-translation without compromising quality. Additionally, it
significantly reduces flickering by 80% by incorporating the display-only
mask-k technique.

TL;DR: TwS框架通过音频思维链增强大型音频语言模型，在复杂声学场景中结合语言推理和实时音频分析，显著提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型音频语言模型在复杂声学场景中表现不佳，缺乏噪声抑制、源分离等声学工具的支持，需要增强音频推理能力。

Method: 提出Thinking-with-Sound框架，通过音频思维链将语言推理与实时音频域分析相结合，使模型能够主动对音频信号进行数值分析和数字处理。

Result: 在MELD-Hard1k基准测试中，TwS显著提升模型鲁棒性，小模型准确率提升24.73%，大模型提升36.61%，而现有模型在扰动音频上准确率下降超过50%。

Conclusion: 音频思维链无需重新训练即可显著增强模型鲁棒性，为开发更强大的音频理解系统开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have shown strong performance on
various audio understanding tasks such as speech translation and Audio Q\&A.
However, they exhibit significant limitations on challenging audio reasoning
tasks in complex acoustic scenarios. These situations would greatly benefit
from the use of acoustic tools like noise suppression, source separation, and
precise temporal alignment, but current LALMs lack access to such tools. To
address this limitation, we introduce Thinking-with-Sound (TwS), a framework
that equips LALMs with Audio CoT by combining linguistic reasoning with
on-the-fly audio-domain analysis. Unlike existing approaches that treat audio
as static input, TwS enables models to actively think with audio signals,
performing numerical analysis and digital manipulation through multimodal
reasoning. To evaluate this approach, we construct MELD-Hard1k, a new
robustness benchmark created by introducing various acoustic perturbations.
Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LALMs suffer dramatic performance
degradation on MELD-Hard1k, with accuracy dropping by more than $50\%$ compared
to clean audio. TwS achieves substantial improvements in robustness,
demonstrating both effectiveness and scalability: small models gain $24.73\%$
absolute accuracy, with improvements scaling consistently up to $36.61\%$ for
larger models. Our findings demonstrate that Audio CoT can significantly
enhance robustness without retraining, opening new directions for developing
more robust audio understanding systems.

Conclusion: 证明了单一生成基础模型在工业级统一信息访问中的可行性。

Abstract: The dominant retrieve-then-rank pipeline in large-scale recommender systems
suffers from mis-calibration and engineering overhead due to its architectural
split and differing optimization objectives. While recent generative sequence
models have shown promise in unifying retrieval and ranking by
auto-regressively generating ranked items, existing solutions typically address
either personalized search or query-free recommendation, often exhibiting
performance trade-offs when attempting to unify both. We introduce
\textit{SynerGen}, a novel generative recommender model that bridges this
critical gap by providing a single generative backbone for both personalized
search and recommendation, while simultaneously excelling at retrieval and
ranking tasks. Trained on behavioral sequences, our decoder-only Transformer
leverages joint optimization with InfoNCE for retrieval and a hybrid
pointwise-pairwise loss for ranking, allowing semantic signals from search to
improve recommendation and vice versa. We also propose a novel time-aware
rotary positional embedding to effectively incorporate time information into
the attention mechanism. \textit{SynerGen} achieves significant improvements on
widely adopted recommendation and search benchmarks compared to strong
generative recommender and joint search and recommendation baselines. This work
demonstrates the viability of a single generative foundation model for
industrial-scale unified information access.

*Han Yuan,Yue Zhao,Li Zhang,Wuqiong Luo,Zheng Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文使用因果推断方法分析结构化输出对LLM生成质量的影响，发现粗粒度指标显示正负或中性影响，但因果分析显示在48个场景中43个无因果影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究对结构化输出对LLM生成质量的影响存在矛盾结论，且评估存在测试场景受限、比较设置控制弱、依赖粗粒度指标等局限性。

Method: 基于一个假设和两个保证约束，推导出五种潜在因果结构，在八个推理任务上进行因果推断分析。

Result: 粗粒度指标报告结构化输出对GPT-4o生成有正、负或中性影响，但因果推断显示48个场景中43个无因果影响，剩余5个中3个涉及由具体指令影响的多方面因果结构。

Conclusion: 结构化输出对LLM生成质量的影响比先前研究显示的更为复杂，因果分析提供了更精确的评估，揭示了大多数情况下无因果影响。

Abstract: Structured output from large language models (LLMs) has enhanced efficiency
in processing generated information and is increasingly adopted in industrial
applications. Prior studies have investigated the impact of structured output
on LLMs' generation quality, often presenting one-way findings. Some suggest
that structured format enhances completeness and factual accuracy, while others
argue that it restricts the reasoning capacity of LLMs and leads to reductions
in standard evaluation metrics. Potential limitations of these assessments
include restricted testing scenarios, weakly controlled comparative settings,
and reliance on coarse metrics. In this work, we present a refined analysis
using causal inference. Based on one assumed and two guaranteed constraints, we
derive five potential causal structures characterizing the influence of
structured output on LLMs' generation: (1) collider without m-bias, (2)
collider with m-bias, (3) single cause from instruction, (4) single cause from
output format, and (5) independence. Across seven public and one developed
reasoning tasks, we find that coarse metrics report positive, negative, or
neutral effects of structured output on GPT-4o's generation. However, causal
inference reveals no causal impact in 43 out of 48 scenarios. In the remaining
5, 3 involve multifaceted causal structures influenced by concrete
instructions.

TL;DR: 提出了CARB基准来评估奖励模型的文化意识，发现现有模型存在缺陷，并提出Think-as-Locals方法通过RLVR来改进文化感知奖励建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型评估缺乏文化意识评估数据集，无法有效评估模型对不同文化的理解能力，阻碍了LLMs的全球对齐发展。

Method: 构建CARB基准覆盖10种文化和4个文化领域；提出Think-as-Locals方法，使用RLVR激发生成式奖励模型进行更深层次的文化推理，并通过精心设计的奖励确保准确的偏好判断和高质量的结构化评估标准生成。

Result: 评估显示现有最先进奖励模型在文化意识建模方面存在缺陷；CARB性能与下游多语言文化对齐任务呈正相关；Think-as-Locals能有效缓解虚假特征干扰并推进文化感知奖励建模。

Conclusion: CARB基准填补了文化意识评估的空白，Think-as-Locals方法通过RLVR有效提升了奖励模型的文化理解能力，为LLMs的全球对齐提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with diverse cultures. Consequently, evaluating their cultural awareness is
essential for further advancing global alignment of LLMs. However, existing RM
evaluations fall short in assessing cultural awareness due to the scarcity of
culturally relevant evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we propose Cultural
Awareness Reward modeling Benchmark (CARB), covering 10 distinct cultures
across 4 cultural domains. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art RMs
reveals their deficiencies in modeling cultural awareness and demonstrates a
positive correlation between performance on CARB and downstream multilingual
cultural alignment tasks. Further analysis identifies the spurious correlations
within culture-aware reward modeling, wherein RM's scoring relies predominantly
on surface-level features rather than authentic cultural nuance understanding.
To address these, we propose Think-as-Locals to elicit deeper culturally
grounded reasoning from generative RMs via reinforcement learning from
verifiable rewards (RLVR) and employ well-designed rewards to ensure accurate
preference judgments and high-quality structured evaluation criteria
generation. Experimental results validate its efficacy in mitigating spurious
features interference and advancing culture-aware reward modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种扩展动作空间的同步机器翻译方法，通过引入四种自适应动作（句子切割、删除、部分摘要和代词化）来改善实时翻译的质量和延迟表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码器-解码器策略的READ/WRITE动作无法充分解决同步机器翻译在严格实时约束下的高质量翻译需求，需要扩展动作空间来支持实时重构、省略和简化。

Method: 在仅解码器的大语言模型框架中实现四种自适应动作，通过动作感知提示构建训练参考，并开发延迟感知的TTS管道来评估质量和延迟。

Result: 在ACL60/60英中和英德基准测试中，该框架持续改善语义指标（如COMET-KIWI），并实现比参考翻译和基于salami的基线更低的延迟（通过平均滞后测量）。

Conclusion: 丰富基于LLM的同步机器翻译的动作空间为弥合人机解释差距提供了一个有前景的方向，特别是结合删除和句子切割动作能在流畅性和延迟之间达到最佳平衡。

Abstract: Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) requires high-quality translations
under strict real-time constraints, which traditional encoder-decoder policies
with only READ/WRITE actions cannot fully address. We extend the action space
of SiMT with four adaptive actions: SENTENCE_CUT, DROP, PARTIAL_SUMMARIZATION
and PRONOMINALIZATION, which enable real-time restructuring, omission, and
simplification while preserving semantic fidelity. We implement these actions
in a decoder-only large language model (LLM) framework and construct training
references through action-aware prompting. To evaluate both quality and
latency, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual
outputs to speech with realistic timing. Experiments on the ACL60/60
English-Chinese and English-German benchmarks show that our framework
consistently improves semantic metrics (e.g., COMET-KIWI) and achieves lower
delay (measured by Average Lagging) compared to reference translations and
salami-based baselines. Notably, combining DROP and SENTENCE_CUT yields the
best overall balance between fluency and latency. These results demonstrate
that enriching the action space of LLM-based SiMT provides a promising
direction for bridging the gap between human and machine interpretation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于"学习注意力"的方法容易受到数据集偏差影响，将统计捷径与真实因果特征混淆，导致分布外泛化性能下降。

Method: 应用信息瓶颈过滤单模态输入，使用参数化掩码生成器解耦多模态表示为因果和捷径子表示，结合工具变量约束和反向门调整稳定因果估计。

Result: 在多模态情感分析、幽默检测和讽刺检测任务及OOD测试集上验证了CaMIB的有效性，理论和实证分析显示其可解释性和稳健性。

Conclusion: CaMIB模型通过因果原则有效缓解数据集偏差问题，提升多模态语言理解的分布外泛化能力，具有良好可解释性。

Abstract: Human Multimodal Language Understanding (MLU) aims to infer human intentions
by integrating related cues from heterogeneous modalities. Existing works
predominantly follow a ``learning to attend" paradigm, which maximizes mutual
information between data and labels to enhance predictive performance. However,
such methods are vulnerable to unintended dataset biases, causing models to
conflate statistical shortcuts with genuine causal features and resulting in
degraded out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. To alleviate this issue, we
introduce a Causal Multimodal Information Bottleneck (CaMIB) model that
leverages causal principles rather than traditional likelihood. Concretely, we
first applies the information bottleneck to filter unimodal inputs, removing
task-irrelevant noise. A parameterized mask generator then disentangles the
fused multimodal representation into causal and shortcut subrepresentations. To
ensure global consistency of causal features, we incorporate an instrumental
variable constraint, and further adopt backdoor adjustment by randomly
recombining causal and shortcut features to stabilize causal estimation.
Extensive experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis, humor detection, and
sarcasm detection, along with OOD test sets, demonstrate the effectiveness of
CaMIB. Theoretical and empirical analyses further highlight its
interpretability and soundness.

Motivation: 通过自动化谜题生成来扩大语言学的兴趣范围，向更广泛的受众介绍该领域，同时支持稀有和未充分研究语言的知识传播。

Method: 扩展现有语言谜题基准，使用包括OpenAI o1在内的先进LLMs测试解决各种语言学主题谜题的能力，并基于解决实验的洞察指导谜题生成任务。

Result: LLMs在大多数谜题类型上表现优于人类，但在文字系统和未充分研究语言的谜题上表现较差。

Conclusion: 语言谜题生成作为一个研究任务具有重要意义，不仅能促进语言学发展，还能支持稀有语言知识的传播，自动化谜题生成具有扩大语言学影响力的潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a combination of novel and exciting tasks: the
solution and generation of linguistic puzzles. We focus on puzzles used in
Linguistic Olympiads for high school students. We first extend the existing
benchmark for the task of solving linguistic puzzles. We explore the use of
Large Language Models (LLMs), including recent state-of-the-art models such as
OpenAI's o1, for solving linguistic puzzles, analyzing their performance across
various linguistic topics. We demonstrate that LLMs outperform humans on most
puzzles types, except for those centered on writing systems, and for the
understudied languages. We use the insights from puzzle-solving experiments to
direct the novel task of puzzle generation. We believe that automating puzzle
generation, even for relatively simple puzzles, holds promise for expanding
interest in linguistics and introducing the field to a broader audience. This
finding highlights the importance of linguistic puzzle generation as a research
task: such puzzles can not only promote linguistics but also support the
dissemination of knowledge about rare and understudied languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ResT方法，通过基于熵的token重加权来重塑策略梯度，以优化LLM在工具使用任务中的训练效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL方法在优化LLM工具使用策略时仅依赖稀疏结果奖励，缺乏对工具使用任务特殊性的考虑，导致策略梯度方差大、训练效率低。

Method: ResT通过熵感知的token重加权来重塑策略梯度，在训练过程中逐步增加推理token的权重，实现从结构正确性到语义推理的平滑过渡。

Result: 在BFCL和API-Bank评估中，ResT达到最先进结果，比先前方法提升高达8.76%。在4B基础LLM上微调后，在单轮任务上超越GPT-4o 4.11%，在多轮基础任务上超越1.50%。

Conclusion: ResT通过熵感知的token级策略梯度重塑，有效稳定了多轮工具使用任务的收敛，显著提升了LLM在工具使用任务中的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) transcend passive generation and act as
goal-directed agents by invoking external tools. Reinforcement learning (RL)
offers a principled framework for optimizing these emergent tool-use policies,
yet the prevailing paradigm relies exclusively on sparse outcome rewards and
lacks consideration of the particularity of tool-use tasks, inflating
policy-gradient variance and resulting in inefficient training. To better
understand and address these challenges, we first establish a theoretical link
between policy entropy and training stability of tool-use tasks, which reveals
that structured, low-entropy tokens are primary determinants of rewards.
Motivated by this insight, we propose \textbf{Res}haped \textbf{T}oken-level
policy gradients (\textbf{ResT}) for tool-use tasks. ResT reshapes the policy
gradient through entropy-informed token reweighting, progressively upweighting
reasoning tokens as training proceeds. This entropy-aware scheme enables a
smooth shift from structural correctness to semantic reasoning and stabilizes
convergence in multi-turn tool-use tasks. Evaluation on BFCL and API-Bank shows
that ResT achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming prior methods by up
to $8.76\%$. When fine-tuned on a 4B base LLM, ResT further surpasses GPT-4o by
$4.11\%$ on single-turn tasks and $1.50\%$ on multi-turn base tasks.

*Duncan Soiffer,Steven Kolawole,Virginia Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于语义一致性的级联系统，通过模型输出的语义共识来判断可靠性，实现成本降低40%、延迟减少60%的高效LLM部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 级联系统在开放文本生成中面临根本挑战：难以确定输出的可靠性，因为生成质量是连续的，且存在多个有效响应。

Method: 提出语义一致性作为训练无关的延迟信号，当不同模型输出在语义层面达成共识时，将其作为比词元级置信度更强的可靠性信号。

Result: 在500M到70B参数模型上的评估显示，语义级联以40%的成本达到或超过目标模型质量，延迟减少高达60%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需模型内部信息，适用于黑盒API，对模型更新具有鲁棒性，为实际LLM部署提供了实用的基准方案。

Abstract: Cascade systems route computational requests to smaller models when possible
and defer to larger models only when necessary, offering a promising approach
to balance cost and quality in LLM deployment. However, they face a fundamental
challenge in open-ended text generation: determining output reliability when
generation quality lies on a continuous spectrum, often with multiple valid
responses. To address this, we propose semantic agreement -- meaning-level
consensus between ensemble outputs -- as a training-free signal for reliable
deferral. We show that when diverse model outputs agree semantically, their
consensus is a stronger reliability signal than token-level confidence.
Evaluated from 500M to 70B-parameter models, we find that semantic cascades
match or surpass target-model quality at 40% of the cost and reduce latency by
up to 60%. Our method requires no model internals, works across black-box APIs,
and remains robust to model updates, making it a practical baseline for
real-world LLM deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在专业模型的深度分析和大型语言模型的生成流畅性之间存在核心权衡，需要一种能同时兼顾两者的共情响应生成方法。

Method: 提出TRACE框架，将共情任务分解为分析和合成的管道，通过先建立全面理解再进行生成，将深度分析与表达性生成相结合。

Result: 实验结果显示，TRACE框架在自动评估和基于LLM的评估中都显著优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 结构化分解是创建更强大和可解释共情代理的有前景范式。

Abstract: Empathetic response generation is a crucial task for creating more human-like
and supportive conversational agents. However, existing methods face a core
trade-off between the analytical depth of specialized models and the generative
fluency of Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose TRACE,
Task-decomposed Reasoning for Affective Communication and Empathy, a novel
framework that models empathy as a structured cognitive process by decomposing
the task into a pipeline for analysis and synthesis. By building a
comprehensive understanding before generation, TRACE unites deep analysis with
expressive generation. Experimental results show that our framework
significantly outperforms strong baselines in both automatic and LLM-based
evaluations, confirming that our structured decomposition is a promising
paradigm for creating more capable and interpretable empathetic agents. Our
code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TRACE-18EF/README.md.

TL;DR: 提出了首个多轮长形式问答基准KnowMT-Bench，用于评估大语言模型在知识密集型领域的表现，发现多轮对话会降低事实准确性和信息效率，但检索增强生成可以缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注单轮对话，而多轮对话基准通常评估其他能力而非知识密集型事实性，需要填补这一关键空白。

Method: 创建KnowMT-Bench基准，采用动态评估设置，让模型基于逻辑递进的问题序列生成自己的多轮对话历史，然后使用人工验证的自动化流程评估最终轮答案的事实能力和信息传递效率。

Result: 多轮上下文会降低性能：由于自生成历史带来的上下文噪声，事实能力下降；随着对话长度增加，模型变得更加冗长，信息效率下降。检索增强生成可以有效缓解甚至逆转这种事实退化。

Conclusion: 该基准对于评估和增强大语言模型在现实世界知识密集型应用中的对话事实能力具有重要意义。

Abstract: Multi-Turn Long-Form Question Answering (MT-LFQA) is a key application
paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive domains.
However, existing benchmarks are limited to single-turn dialogue, while
multi-turn dialogue benchmarks typically assess other orthogonal capabilities
rather than knowledge-intensive factuality. To bridge this critical gap, we
introduce \textbf{KnowMT-Bench}, the \textit{first-ever} benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate MT-LFQA for LLMs across knowledge-intensive fields,
including medicine, finance, and law. To faithfully assess the model's
real-world performance, KnowMT-Bench employs a dynamic evaluation setting where
models generate their own multi-turn dialogue histories given logically
progressive question sequences. The factual capability and information delivery
efficiency of the \textit{final-turn} answer are then evaluated using a
human-validated automated pipeline. Our experiments reveal that multi-turn
contexts degrade performance: factual capability declines due to the contextual
noise from self-generated histories, while information efficiency drops as
models become more verbose with increasing dialogue length. We then investigate
mitigation strategies, demonstrating that retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
can effectively alleviate and even reverse this factual degradation. These
findings underscore the importance of our benchmark in evaluating and enhancing
the conversational factual capabilities of LLMs in real-world
knowledge-intensive applications. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA的线性特性限制了其表达能力，需要开发非线性扩展来提升性能。

Method: 提出LoRAN方法，对低秩更新应用轻量级变换，并引入Sinter正弦激活函数来添加结构化扰动而不增加参数数量。

Result: 在摘要生成和分类任务上的实验表明，LoRAN持续优于QLoRA，消融研究显示Sinter激活函数优于Sigmoid、ReLU和Tanh等标准激活函数。

Conclusion: 激活函数设计在低秩调优中至关重要，LoRAN通过非线性扩展有效提升了LoRA的性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient
fine-tuning method for large language models. However, its linear nature limits
expressiveness. We propose LoRAN, a non-linear extension of LoRA that applies
lightweight transformations to the low-rank updates. We further introduce
Sinter, a sine-based activation that adds structured perturbations without
increasing parameter count. Experiments across summarization and classification
tasks show that LoRAN consistently improves over QLoRA. Ablation studies reveal
that Sinter outperforms standard activations such as Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh,
highlighting the importance of activation design in lowrank tuning.

TL;DR: LUMINA是一个检测RAG系统中幻觉的新框架，通过量化外部上下文利用和内部知识利用来检测幻觉，无需大量超参数调优，在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统即使提供了正确且充分的上下文，LLMs仍然会产生幻觉。现有方法需要大量超参数调优，限制了其泛化能力。

Method: 通过分布距离量化外部上下文利用，通过跟踪预测token在transformer层间的演化来测量内部知识利用，并引入统计验证框架。

Result: 在常见RAG幻觉基准测试和四个开源LLMs上，LUMINA实现了持续高的AUROC和AUPRC分数，在HalluRAG上比现有方法AUROC提升高达+13%。

Conclusion: LUMINA在检索质量和模型匹配的宽松假设下保持鲁棒性，提供了有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to mitigate hallucinations in large
language models (LLMs) by grounding responses in retrieved documents. Yet,
RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even when provided with correct and sufficient
context. A growing line of work suggests that this stems from an imbalance
between how models use external context and their internal knowledge, and
several approaches have attempted to quantify these signals for hallucination
detection. However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning,
limiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that
detects hallucinations in RAG systems through context-knowledge signals:
external context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while
internal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens
evolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for
statistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG
hallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves
consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based
methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under
relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both
effectiveness and practicality.

TL;DR: 提出RL-ZVP算法，从零方差提示中提取学习信号，在数学推理基准上显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法如GRPO只关注响应正确性不同的提示，忽略了所有响应获得相同奖励的零方差提示，而这些提示实际上可以提供有意义的学习反馈

Method: RL-ZVP算法直接从零方差提示中提取学习信号，通过奖励正确性和惩罚错误来优化策略，并使用token级特征调节反馈以保留信息丰富的信号

Result: 在六个数学推理基准上，RL-ZVP相比GRPO在准确率上提升高达8.61个百分点，通过率提升7.77个百分点，且持续优于过滤掉零方差提示的其他基线方法

Conclusion: 零方差提示在RLVR中具有未开发的潜力，RL-ZVP证明了从这些提示中学习的有效性

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful framework
for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
current methods such as GRPO rely only on problems where the model responses to
the same input differ in correctness, while ignoring those where all responses
receive the same reward - so-called zero-variance prompts. In this work, we
argue that such prompts are not useless but can, in fact, provide meaningful
feedback for policy optimization. To this end, we introduce RL with
Zero-Variance Prompts (RL-ZVP), a novel algorithm that extract learning signals
from zero-variance prompts. RL-ZVP directly rewards correctness and penalizes
errors even without contrasting responses, modulating feedback with token-level
characteristics to preserve informative, nuanced signals. Across six math
reasoning benchmarks, RL-ZVP achieves significant improvements of up to 8.61
points in accuracy and 7.77 points in pass rate over GRPO, while consistently
outperforming other baselines that filter out zero-variance prompts. These
results highlight the untapped potential of learning from zero-variance prompts
in RLVR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型评估方法仅关注输出正确性，忽视了用户交互体验的重要性，无法捕捉用户满意度的形成机制。

Method: 识别影响用户体验的因素，在多种配置下进行受控实验收集人类评分，构建QoE导向数据库并训练预测模型。

Result: QoNext框架能够实现主动和细粒度的评估，并为实际产品化服务提供优化基础模型的可操作指导。

Conclusion: QoNext成功将QoE原则应用于基础模型评估，填补了传统评估方法的空白，为优化用户体验提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Existing evaluations of foundation models, including recent human-centric
approaches, fail to capture what truly matters: user's experience during
interaction. Current methods treat evaluation as a matter of output correctness
alone, overlooking that user satisfaction emerges from the interplay between
response quality and interaction, which limits their ability to account for the
mechanisms underlying user experience. To address this gap, we introduce
QoNext, the first framework that adapts Quality of Experience (QoE) principles
from networking and multimedia to the assessment of foundation models. QoNext
identifies experiential factors that shape user experience and incorporates
them into controlled experiments, where human ratings are collected under
varied configurations. From these studies we construct a QoE-oriented database
and train predictive models that estimate perceived user experience from
measurable system parameters. Our results demonstrate that QoNext not only
enables proactive and fine-grained evaluation but also provides actionable
guidance for productized services of optimizing foundation models in practice.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE)训练框架，解决了MoE模型在推理时增加激活专家数量导致性能下降的问题，通过训练专家在多样化组合中协作，显著扩展了性能扩展范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型在推理时增加激活专家数量反而会导致性能下降，这是因为专家之间缺乏学习到的协作能力。

Method: 提出EMoE训练框架，同时训练专家在多样化组合中协作，并鼓励路由器进行高质量选择，无需额外训练开销。

Result: EMoE将有效性能扩展范围扩展到训练时k值的2-3倍，同时将模型峰值性能推向更高水平。

Conclusion: EMoE框架成功解决了MoE模型在推理时扩展专家数量的性能下降问题，实现了更灵活的计算预算适应能力。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models typically fix the number of activated experts
$k$ at both training and inference. Intuitively, activating more experts at
inference $k'$ (where $k'> k$) means engaging a larger set of model parameters
for the computation and thus is expected to improve performance. However,
contrary to this intuition, we find the scaling range to be so narrow that
performance begins to degrade rapidly after only a slight increase in the
number of experts. Further investigation reveals that this degradation stems
from a lack of learned collaboration among experts. To address this, we
introduce Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel training framework that
enables MoE models to scale the number of activated experts at inference
without incurring additional training overhead. By simultaneously training
experts to collaborate in diverse combinations and encouraging the router for
high-quality selections, EMoE ensures robust performance across computational
budgets at inference. We conduct extensive experiments on various MoE settings.
Our results show that EMoE significantly expands the effective
performance-scaling range, extending it to as much as 2-3$\times$ the
training-time $k$, while also pushing the model's peak performance to a higher
level.

*Kemal Sami Karaca,Bahaeddin Eravcı*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个针对土耳其语引文意图分类的系统方法，包括创建首个公开的土耳其语引文意图数据集，使用DSPy框架自动化提示优化，并通过堆叠集成方法达到91.3%的最先进准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解引文的定性意图对学术研究评估至关重要，但土耳其语作为黏着语在引文意图分类方面面临独特挑战，需要专门的方法和数据集。

Method: 首先创建了土耳其语引文意图数据集，然后使用DSPy框架构建可编程分类管道来自动化提示优化，最后采用堆叠泛化集成方法（XGBoost元模型）聚合多个优化模型的输出。

Result: 提出的堆叠集成方法达到了91.3%的最先进准确率，显著优于标准上下文学习方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为土耳其NLP社区和更广泛的学术界提供了基础数据集和鲁棒的分类框架，为未来的定性引文研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Understanding the qualitative intent of citations is essential for a
comprehensive assessment of academic research, a task that poses unique
challenges for agglutinative languages like Turkish. This paper introduces a
systematic methodology and a foundational dataset to address this problem. We
first present a new, publicly available dataset of Turkish citation intents,
created with a purpose-built annotation tool. We then evaluate the performance
of standard In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs),
demonstrating that its effectiveness is limited by inconsistent results caused
by manually designed prompts. To address this core limitation, we introduce a
programmable classification pipeline built on the DSPy framework, which
automates prompt optimization systematically. For final classification, we
employ a stacked generalization ensemble to aggregate outputs from multiple
optimized models, ensuring stable and reliable predictions. This ensemble, with
an XGBoost meta-model, achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 91.3\%.
Ultimately, this study provides the Turkish NLP community and the broader
academic circles with a foundational dataset and a robust classification
framework paving the way for future qualitative citation studies.

### [44] [AutoSCORE: Enhancing Automated Scoring with Multi-Agent Large Language Models via Structured Component Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21910)
*Yun Wang,Zhaojun Ding,Xuansheng Wu,Siyue Sun,Ninghao Liu,Xiaoming Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoSCORE是一个多代理LLM框架，通过基于评分标准的结构化组件识别来增强自动评分，解决了传统LLM评分中的准确性低、提示敏感、可解释性差和评分标准不对齐等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM作为端到端评分器面临的挑战，包括低准确性、提示敏感性、有限可解释性和评分标准不对齐，这些阻碍了LLM在评估实践中的应用。

Method: 采用双代理设计：评分标准组件提取代理从学生回答中提取相关组件并编码为结构化表示，评分代理使用该表示分配最终分数，确保模型推理遵循类似人类的评分过程。

Result: 在ASAP基准的四个数据集上，使用GPT-4o、LLaMA-3.1-8B和LLaMA-3.1-70B进行评估，AutoSCORE在评分准确性、人机一致性（QWK、相关性）和误差指标（MAE、RMSE）方面均优于单代理基线，尤其在复杂多维评分标准和小型LLM上表现突出。

Conclusion: 结构化组件识别与多代理设计相结合，为自动评分提供了可扩展、可靠且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated scoring plays a crucial role in education by reducing the reliance
on human raters, offering scalable and immediate evaluation of student work.
While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in this task,
their use as end-to-end raters faces challenges such as low accuracy, prompt
sensitivity, limited interpretability, and rubric misalignment. These issues
hinder the implementation of LLM-based automated scoring in assessment
practice. To address the limitations, we propose AutoSCORE, a multi-agent LLM
framework enhancing automated scoring via rubric-aligned Structured COmponent
REcognition. With two agents, AutoSCORE first extracts rubric-relevant
components from student responses and encodes them into a structured
representation (i.e., Scoring Rubric Component Extraction Agent), which is then
used to assign final scores (i.e., Scoring Agent). This design ensures that
model reasoning follows a human-like grading process, enhancing
interpretability and robustness. We evaluate AutoSCORE on four benchmark
datasets from the ASAP benchmark, using both proprietary and open-source LLMs
(GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.1-8B, and LLaMA-3.1-70B). Across diverse tasks and rubrics,
AutoSCORE consistently improves scoring accuracy, human-machine agreement (QWK,
correlations), and error metrics (MAE, RMSE) compared to single-agent
baselines, with particularly strong benefits on complex, multi-dimensional
rubrics, and especially large relative gains on smaller LLMs. These results
demonstrate that structured component recognition combined with multi-agent
design offers a scalable, reliable, and interpretable solution for automated
scoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有同时语音翻译系统依赖多轮对话任务、需要专门训练数据和计算昂贵的LLM推理的问题，模仿人类口译员的感知决策过程。

Method: 提出SimulSense框架，通过持续读取输入语音并在感知到新感知单元时触发写入决策来产生翻译。

Result: 相比两个最先进的基线系统，实现了更优的质量-延迟权衡，决策速度比基线快9.6倍。

Conclusion: SimulSense框架能够有效模仿人类口译员的决策机制，在同时语音翻译任务中实现高效的质量-延迟平衡。

Abstract: How to make human-interpreter-like read/write decisions for simultaneous
speech translation (SimulST) systems? Current state-of-the-art systems
formulate SimulST as a multi-turn dialogue task, requiring specialized
interleaved training data and relying on computationally expensive large
language model (LLM) inference for decision-making. In this paper, we propose
SimulSense, a novel framework for SimulST that mimics human interpreters by
continuously reading input speech and triggering write decisions to produce
translation when a new sense unit is perceived. Experiments against two
state-of-the-art baseline systems demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
a superior quality-latency tradeoff and substantially improved real-time
efficiency, where its decision-making is up to 9.6x faster than the baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对95个先进大语言模型在87个真实世界临床文本任务上的研究表明，86.3%的模型在思维链提示下性能下降，与通用领域相反，揭示了临床文本中增强可解释性与可靠性之间的关键悖论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索思维链提示在临床文本理解中的有效性，特别是在电子健康记录这种冗长、碎片化和嘈杂的数据环境中，确保LLM在临床应用中既准确又透明。

Method: 对95个先进LLM在87个真实世界临床文本任务上进行大规模系统研究，涵盖9种语言和8种任务类型，使用思维链提示并分析推理长度、医学概念对齐和错误模式。

Result: 86.3%的模型在思维链设置下性能持续下降，能力更强的模型相对稳健，而较弱模型性能大幅下降，揭示了临床文本中思维链的负面效应。

Conclusion: 思维链在临床文本任务中虽然增强可解释性，但可能削弱可靠性，突出了在临床环境中开发透明且可信赖方法的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to clinical care,
a domain where both accuracy and transparent reasoning are critical for safe
and trustworthy deployment. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which elicits
step-by-step reasoning, has demonstrated improvements in performance and
interpretability across a wide range of tasks. However, its effectiveness in
clinical contexts remains largely unexplored, particularly in the context of
electronic health records (EHRs), the primary source of clinical documentation,
which are often lengthy, fragmented, and noisy. In this work, we present the
first large-scale systematic study of CoT for clinical text understanding. We
assess 95 advanced LLMs on 87 real-world clinical text tasks, covering 9
languages and 8 task types. Contrary to prior findings in other domains, we
observe that 86.3\% of models suffer consistent performance degradation in the
CoT setting. More capable models remain relatively robust, while weaker ones
suffer substantial declines. To better characterize these effects, we perform
fine-grained analyses of reasoning length, medical concept alignment, and error
profiles, leveraging both LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and clinical expert
evaluation. Our results uncover systematic patterns in when and why CoT fails
in clinical contexts, which highlight a critical paradox: CoT enhances
interpretability but may undermine reliability in clinical text tasks. This
work provides an empirical basis for clinical reasoning strategies of LLMs,
highlighting the need for transparent and trustworthy approaches.

*Kasidit Sermsri,Teerapong Panboonyuen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ThaiFACTUAL框架，用于在泰国政治立场检测中减轻LLMs的系统性偏见，通过反事实数据增强和基于理由的监督来解耦情感与立场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源和文化复杂环境中，LLMs在政治立场检测时存在系统性偏见，如情感泄漏和实体偏袒，影响公平性和可靠性。

Method: 使用反事实数据增强和基于理由的监督，无需微调即可减轻政治偏见，并发布了首个高质量的泰国政治立场数据集。

Result: ThaiFACTUAL显著减少了虚假相关性，增强了零样本泛化能力，并提高了多个LLMs的公平性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了针对代表性不足语言的文化基础去偏见技术的重要性。

Abstract: Political stance detection in low-resource and culturally complex settings
poses a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). In the Thai
political landscape - marked by indirect language, polarized figures, and
entangled sentiment and stance - LLMs often display systematic biases such as
sentiment leakage and favoritism toward entities. These biases undermine
fairness and reliability. We present ThaiFACTUAL, a lightweight, model-agnostic
calibration framework that mitigates political bias without requiring
fine-tuning. ThaiFACTUAL uses counterfactual data augmentation and
rationale-based supervision to disentangle sentiment from stance and reduce
bias. We also release the first high-quality Thai political stance dataset,
annotated with stance, sentiment, rationales, and bias markers across diverse
entities and events. Experimental results show that ThaiFACTUAL significantly
reduces spurious correlations, enhances zero-shot generalization, and improves
fairness across multiple LLMs. This work highlights the importance of
culturally grounded debiasing techniques for underrepresented languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MotivGraph-SoIQ框架，结合动机知识图谱和苏格拉底对话，解决LLM在学术构思中的基础不足和确认偏误问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在加速学术构思方面潜力巨大，但面临基础不足和确认偏误的关键挑战，需要改进以支持进一步细化。

Method: 集成动机知识图谱(MotivGraph)和Q驱动的苏格拉底构思器。MotivGraph结构化存储问题、挑战和解决方案三类节点，为LLM构思提供动机基础。构思器是双代理系统，利用苏格拉底提问促进严格改进过程。

Result: 在ICLR25论文主题数据集上，MotivGraph-SoIQ在基于LLM的评分、ELO排名和人工评估指标上均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过提供基础支持和实际想法改进步骤，有效提升了LLM构思的质量，在新颖性、实验严谨性和动机合理性维度均有改善。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold substantial potential for accelerating
academic ideation but face critical challenges in grounding ideas and
mitigating confirmation bias for further refinement. We propose integrating
motivational knowledge graphs and socratic dialogue to address these
limitations in enhanced LLM ideation (MotivGraph-SoIQ). This novel framework
provides essential grounding and practical idea improvement steps for LLM
ideation by integrating a Motivational Knowledge Graph (MotivGraph) with a
Q-Driven Socratic Ideator. The MotivGraph structurally stores three key node
types(problem, challenge and solution) to offer motivation grounding for the
LLM ideation process. The Ideator is a dual-agent system utilizing Socratic
questioning, which facilitates a rigorous refinement process that mitigates
confirmation bias and improves idea quality across novelty, experimental rigor,
and motivational rationality dimensions. On the ICLR25 paper topics dataset,
MotivGraph-SoIQ exhibits clear advantages over existing state-of-the-art
approaches across LLM-based scoring, ELO ranking, and human evaluation metrics.

*Seongho Joo,Kyungmin Min,Jahyun Koo,Kyomin Jung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不确定性的黑盒幻觉检测方法，通过分析LLMs在不确定性表达下的行为模式来检测事实性错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法需要外部资源或LLMs内部状态，但在黑盒场景下这些信息不可用，因此需要开发不依赖内部状态的黑盒检测方法。

Method: 通过研究LLMs在不确定性表达下的行为，发现事实性回答具有一致性，而非事实性回答则不一致，基于此设计黑盒检测指标。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比使用LLMs内部知识的基线方法更能预测模型回答的事实性。

Conclusion: 提出的黑盒幻觉检测方法有效且实用，为限制性API场景下的幻觉检测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Despite the great advancement of Language modeling in recent days, Large
Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT3 are notorious for generating non-factual
responses, so-called "hallucination" problems. Existing methods for detecting
and alleviating this hallucination problem require external resources or the
internal state of LLMs, such as the output probability of each token. Given the
LLM's restricted external API availability and the limited scope of external
resources, there is an urgent demand to establish the Black-Box approach as the
cornerstone for effective hallucination detection. In this work, we propose a
simple black-box hallucination detection metric after the investigation of the
behavior of LLMs under expression of uncertainty. Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that LLMs generate consistent responses when they present factual
responses while non-consistent responses vice versa. Based on the analysis, we
propose an efficient black-box hallucination detection metric with the
expression of uncertainty. The experiment demonstrates that our metric is more
predictive of the factuality in model responses than baselines that use
internal knowledge of LLMs.

TL;DR: GraphSearch是一个新颖的基于代理的深度搜索工作流，通过双通道检索策略解决现有GraphRAG方法的浅层检索和结构图数据利用不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GraphRAG方法面临两个核心限制：浅层检索无法发现所有关键证据，以及预构建结构图数据的低效利用，这阻碍了从复杂查询中进行有效推理。

Method: GraphSearch采用模块化框架，包含六个模块，支持多轮交互和迭代推理。采用双通道检索策略，在基于块文本数据上执行语义查询，在结构图数据上执行关系查询。

Result: 在六个多跳RAG基准测试上的实验结果表明，GraphSearch在答案准确性和生成质量方面持续优于传统策略。

Conclusion: GraphSearch是推进图检索增强生成的一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) enhances factual reasoning in
LLMs by structurally modeling knowledge through graph-based representations.
However, existing GraphRAG approaches face two core limitations: shallow
retrieval that fails to surface all critical evidence, and inefficient
utilization of pre-constructed structural graph data, which hinders effective
reasoning from complex queries. To address these challenges, we propose
\textsc{GraphSearch}, a novel agentic deep searching workflow with dual-channel
retrieval for GraphRAG. \textsc{GraphSearch} organizes the retrieval process
into a modular framework comprising six modules, enabling multi-turn
interactions and iterative reasoning. Furthermore, \textsc{GraphSearch} adopts
a dual-channel retrieval strategy that issues semantic queries over chunk-based
text data and relational queries over structural graph data, enabling
comprehensive utilization of both modalities and their complementary strengths.
Experimental results across six multi-hop RAG benchmarks demonstrate that
\textsc{GraphSearch} consistently improves answer accuracy and generation
quality over the traditional strategy, confirming \textsc{GraphSearch} as a
promising direction for advancing graph retrieval-augmented generation.

Motivation: 探讨异常值在动态新闻语料中作为新兴主题早期信号的作用，挑战传统主题建模中将异常值视为噪声的观点。

Method: 使用最先进语言模型的向量嵌入和累积聚类方法，在法语和英语新闻数据集上跟踪异常值随时间演变，关注企业社会责任和气候变化主题。

Result: 结果显示异常值倾向于随时间发展成连贯的主题，这一模式在两种模型和语言中均保持一致。

Conclusion: 异常值不应被简单视为噪声，而是新兴主题的早期指示器，对动态文本分析具有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper examines how outliers, often dismissed as noise in topic modeling,
can act as weak signals of emerging topics in dynamic news corpora. Using
vector embeddings from state-of-the-art language models and a cumulative

news datasets focused on corporate social responsibility and climate change.
The results reveal a consistent pattern: outliers tend to evolve into coherent

Abstract: Safety is a paramount concern in clinical chatbot applications, where
inaccurate or harmful responses can lead to serious consequences. Existing
methods--such as guardrails and tool calling--often fall short in addressing
the nuanced demands of the clinical domain. In this paper, we introduce TACOS
(TAxonomy of COmprehensive Safety for Clinical Agents), a fine-grained,
21-class taxonomy that integrates safety filtering and tool selection into a
single user intent classification step. TACOS is a taxonomy that can cover a
wide spectrum of clinical and non-clinical queries, explicitly modeling varying
safety thresholds and external tool dependencies. To validate our framework, we
curate a TACOS-annotated dataset and perform extensive experiments. Our results
demonstrate the value of a new taxonomy specialized for clinical agent
settings, and reveal useful insights about train data distribution and
pretrained knowledge of base models.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在自然语言处理领域取得了显著进展，但在处理具有歧义、多义或不确定性的文本时仍面临重大挑战。

Method: 引入模糊推理链(FRC)框架，整合LLM语义先验与连续模糊隶属度，在概率推理和模糊隶属推理之间建立显式交互。

Result: 在情感分析任务上的验证表明，FRC确保了稳定的推理并促进了不同模型规模间的知识迁移。

Conclusion: FRC为管理细微和模糊表达提供了一种通用机制，具有改进的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), natural language
processing (NLP) has achieved remarkable progress. Nonetheless, significant
challenges remain in handling texts with ambiguity, polysemy, or uncertainty.
We introduce the Fuzzy Reasoning Chain (FRC) framework, which integrates LLM
semantic priors with continuous fuzzy membership degrees, creating an explicit
interaction between probability-based reasoning and fuzzy membership reasoning.
This transition allows ambiguous inputs to be gradually transformed into clear
and interpretable decisions while capturing conflicting or uncertain signals
that traditional probability-based methods cannot. We validate FRC on sentiment
analysis tasks, where both theoretical analysis and empirical results show that
it ensures stable reasoning and facilitates knowledge transfer across different
model scales. These findings indicate that FRC provides a general mechanism for
managing subtle and ambiguous expressions with improved interpretability and
robustness.

Motivation: 现有数据集主要关注静态AIGT检测，而社交媒体内容具有动态性和时间演化特性，需要纵向数据集来研究AIGT的时序动态和用户交互模式。

Method: 构建了RedNote-Vibe（5年纵向数据集），并提出PLAD框架，利用心理语言学特征进行可解释的AIGT检测。

Result: PLAD实现了优越的检测性能，揭示了人类与AI生成内容的区分特征，并发现了语言特征与社交媒体参与度之间的复杂关系。

Conclusion: RedNote-Vibe数据集和PLAD框架为社交媒体AIGT的时序分析和检测提供了有效工具，揭示了心理语言学特征在AIGT检测中的重要性。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to widespread
AI-Generated Text (AIGT) on social media platforms, creating unique challenges
where content dynamics are driven by user engagement and evolve over time.
However, existing datasets mainly depict static AIGT detection. In this work,
we introduce RedNote-Vibe, the first longitudinal (5-years) dataset for social
media AIGT analysis. This dataset is sourced from Xiaohongshu platform,
containing user engagement metrics (e.g., likes, comments) and timestamps
spanning from the pre-LLM period to July 2025, which enables research into the
temporal dynamics and user interaction patterns of AIGT. Furthermore, to detect
AIGT in the context of social media, we propose PsychoLinguistic AIGT Detection
Framework (PLAD), an interpretable approach that leverages psycholinguistic
features. Our experiments show that PLAD achieves superior detection
performance and provides insights into the signatures distinguishing human and
AI-generated content. More importantly, it reveals the complex relationship
between these linguistic features and social media engagement. The dataset is

TL;DR: QCET提出了一个标准化的质量评估标准分类法，通过从NLP评估调查中提取标准名称和定义，建立层次结构来解决评估结果可比性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP领域中相同质量标准名称（如流畅性）在不同评估中可能衡量不同方面，导致评估结果不可比，阻碍领域科学进展。

Method: 采用严格描述性方法，从三个NLP评估调查中提取质量标准名称和定义，构建层次结构分类法，将数百个现有标准映射到统一框架。

Result: 开发了QCET分类法及其相关资源，为现有评估建立可比性、指导新评估设计、评估监管合规性提供支持。

Conclusion: QCET通过标准化质量评估标准解决了NLP评估可比性问题，为领域科学进步提供了必要基础。

Abstract: Prior work has shown that two NLP evaluation experiments that report results
for the same quality criterion name (e.g. Fluency) do not necessarily evaluate
the same aspect of quality, and the comparability implied by the name can be
misleading. Not knowing when two evaluations are comparable in this sense means
we currently lack the ability to draw reliable conclusions about system quality
on the basis of multiple, independently conducted evaluations. This in turn
hampers the ability of the field to progress scientifically as a whole, a
pervasive issue in NLP since its beginning (Sparck Jones, 1981). It is hard to
see how the issue of unclear comparability can be fully addressed other than by
the creation of a standard set of quality criterion names and definitions that
the several hundred quality criterion names actually in use in the field can be
mapped to, and grounded in. Taking a strictly descriptive approach, the QCET
Quality Criteria for Evaluation Taxonomy derives a standard set of quality
criterion names and definitions from three surveys of evaluations reported in
NLP, and structures them into a hierarchy where each parent node captures
common aspects of its child nodes. We present QCET and the resources it
consists of, and discuss its three main uses in (i) establishing comparability
of existing evaluations, (ii) guiding the design of new evaluations, and (iii)
assessing regulatory compliance.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了微调在模型编辑中无效的传统观念，指出失败源于顺序编辑的深度优先流水线，提出通过恢复广度优先（基于epoch）的流水线和局部调优策略LocFT-BF，显著提升了模型编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战微调在模型编辑中无效的传统观念，认为失败源于不合适的编辑流水线而非微调本身。

Method: 恢复微调到标准的广度优先（epoch-based）流水线，结合小批量优化；通过系统分析调优位置，提出LocFT-BF局部编辑方法。

Result: LocFT-BF在多种LLM和数据集上大幅超越现有方法，首次实现10万次编辑和720亿参数模型的持续编辑，且不牺牲通用能力。

Conclusion: 澄清了对微调的长期误解，将微调从被低估的基线方法提升为模型编辑的领先方法，为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Fine-tuning, a foundational method for adapting large language models, has
long been considered ineffective for model editing. Here, we challenge this
belief, arguing that the reported failure arises not from the inherent
limitation of fine-tuning itself, but from adapting it to the sequential nature
of the editing task, a single-pass depth-first pipeline that optimizes each
sample to convergence before moving on. While intuitive, this depth-first
pipeline coupled with sample-wise updating over-optimizes each edit and induces
interference across edits. Our controlled experiments reveal that simply
restoring fine-tuning to the standard breadth-first (i.e., epoch-based)
pipeline with mini-batch optimization substantially improves its effectiveness
for model editing. Moreover, fine-tuning in editing also suffers from
suboptimal tuning parameter locations inherited from prior methods. Through
systematic analysis of tuning locations, we derive LocFT-BF, a simple and
effective localized editing method built on the restored fine-tuning framework.
Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate that
LocFT-BF outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins. Notably, to our
knowledge, it is the first to sustain 100K edits and 72B-parameter models,10 x
beyond prior practice, without sacrificing general capabilities. By clarifying
a long-standing misconception and introducing a principled localized tuning
strategy, we advance fine-tuning from an underestimated baseline to a leading
method for model editing, establishing a solid foundation for future research.

TL;DR: CoSpaDi是一种无需训练的大语言模型压缩框架，使用结构化稀疏字典学习替代传统的低秩分解，通过数据感知的稀疏因子化实现更好的模型精度保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩权重近似方法结构约束过于刚性，会导致明显的模型精度下降，需要更灵活的压缩方法。

Method: 使用稠密字典和列稀疏系数矩阵的结构化稀疏因子化，通过校准数据集优化因子化以最小化功能重建误差。

Result: 在20-50%压缩比下，在Llama和Qwen模型上表现优于最先进的数据感知低秩方法，在准确性和困惑度方面均更优。

Conclusion: 结构化稀疏字典学习是传统低秩方法的有力替代方案，可实现高效的大语言模型部署。

Abstract: Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on
low-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix
in a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient
strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a
noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression
via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework
that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse
factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense
dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a
union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight
matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected
dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant
basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the
factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers
closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional
reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware
strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under
reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity
allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with
post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate
CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group
settings at 20-50\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority
over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and
perplexity. Our results establish structured sparse dictionary learning as a
powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM
deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了对话行为脚本（DAS）框架，通过结构化对话行为表示来生成多语言对话，避免直接翻译带来的问题，在意大利语、德语和中文上评估显示优于机器和人工翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非英语对话数据集稀缺，现有方法通常基于英语对话翻译，这会引入人工痕迹，降低自然度和文化适宜性。

Method: 使用结构化对话行为表示框架，从抽象意图表示编码、定位和生成多语言对话，而非直接翻译对话语句。

Result: 在意大利语、德语和中文上的人类评估显示，DAS生成的对话在文化相关性、连贯性和情境适宜性方面持续优于机器和人工翻译。

Conclusion: DAS框架能够生成更流畅、自然的对话，缓解翻译腔问题，支持跨语言的灵活本地化。

Abstract: Non-English dialogue datasets are scarce, and models are often trained or
evaluated on translations of English-language dialogues, an approach which can
introduce artifacts that reduce their naturalness and cultural appropriateness.
This work proposes Dialogue Act Script (DAS), a structured framework for
encoding, localizing, and generating multilingual dialogues from abstract
intent representations. Rather than translating dialogue utterances directly,
DAS enables the generation of new dialogues in the target language that are
culturally and contextually appropriate. By using structured dialogue act
representations, DAS supports flexible localization across languages,
mitigating translationese and enabling more fluent, naturalistic conversations.
Human evaluations across Italian, German, and Chinese show that DAS-generated
dialogues consistently outperform those produced by both machine and human
translators on measures of cultural relevance, coherence, and situational
appropriateness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Solve-to-Judge (S2J)方法来解决生成奖励模型中的solve-to-judge差距问题，通过同时利用模型的求解和判断能力进行监督，在减少训练数据量的情况下实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现生成奖励模型存在显著的solve-to-judge差距，即模型能够解决某些问题却无法做出正确判断（14%-37%的查询存在此问题），这限制了模型的判断能力。

Method: 提出S2J方法，在单个GRM的输出上同时利用求解和判断能力进行监督，在模型优化过程中显式地连接问题求解和评估能力，从而缩小差距。

Result: S2J有效减少了16.2%的solve-to-judge差距，将模型的判断性能提升了5.8%，在使用更小训练数据集的情况下实现了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: S2J通过自进化而不依赖更强大的外部模型进行蒸馏，成功解决了生成奖励模型中的solve-to-judge差距问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), generative reward
models (GRMs) have been widely adopted for reward modeling and evaluation.
Previous studies have primarily focused on training specialized GRMs by
optimizing them on preference datasets with the judgment correctness as
supervision. While it's widely accepted that GRMs with stronger problem-solving
capabilities typically exhibit superior judgment abilities, we first identify a
significant solve-to-judge gap when examining individual queries. Specifically,
the solve-to-judge gap refers to the phenomenon where GRMs struggle to make
correct judgments on some queries (14%-37%), despite being fully capable of
solving them. In this paper, we propose the Solve-to-Judge (S2J) approach to
address this problem. Specifically, S2J simultaneously leverages both the
solving and judging capabilities on a single GRM's output for supervision,
explicitly linking the GRM's problem-solving and evaluation abilities during
model optimization, thereby narrowing the gap. Our comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that S2J effectively reduces the solve-to-judge gap by 16.2%,
thereby enhancing the model's judgment performance by 5.8%. Notably, S2J
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among GRMs built on the same base
model while utilizing a significantly smaller training dataset. Moreover, S2J
accomplishes this through self-evolution without relying on more powerful
external models for distillation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于测试时计算扩展（TTS）的方法来验证复杂数值声明，通过训练验证器模型从多个推理路径中选择正确路径，并引入自适应机制提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在验证需要组合推理和数值推理的真实世界数值声明时存在不足，无法理解数值细微差别且容易产生推理漂移问题。

Method: 使用测试时计算扩展（TTS）从LLM中引出多个推理路径，训练验证器模型（VERIFIERFC）选择正确路径，并引入自适应机制基于声明复杂度选择性执行TTS。

Result: TTS显著缓解了推理漂移问题，自适应TTS比标准TTS效率提高1.8倍，比单次声明验证方法性能提升18.8%。

Conclusion: 测试时计算扩展结合验证器模型能有效提升复杂数值声明验证的性能和效率，为事实核查任务提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Fact-checking real-world claims, particularly numerical claims, is inherently
complex that require multistep reasoning and numerical reasoning for verifying
diverse aspects of the claim. Although large language models (LLMs) including
reasoning models have made tremendous advances, they still fall short on
fact-checking real-world claims that require a combination of compositional and
numerical reasoning. They are unable to understand nuance of numerical aspects,
and are also susceptible to the reasoning drift issue, where the model is
unable to contextualize diverse information resulting in misinterpretation and
backtracking of reasoning process. In this work, we systematically explore
scaling test-time compute (TTS) for LLMs on the task of fact-checking complex
numerical claims, which entails eliciting multiple reasoning paths from an LLM.
We train a verifier model (VERIFIERFC) to navigate this space of possible
reasoning paths and select one that could lead to the correct verdict. We
observe that TTS helps mitigate the reasoning drift issue, leading to
significant performance gains for fact-checking numerical claims. To improve
compute efficiency in TTS, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that performs TTS
selectively based on the perceived complexity of the claim. This approach
achieves 1.8x higher efficiency than standard TTS, while delivering a notable
18.8% performance improvement over single-shot claim verification methods. Our

TL;DR: 提出了Uni-LAP框架，通过整合监督分类模型和大型语言模型的优势来解决法律条文预测任务中的挑战，在多法域数据集上表现优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在法律条文预测任务中存在局限性：监督分类模型难以捕捉复杂事实模式，大型语言模型在预测场景中表现不佳，且多数方法缺乏跨法域的通用性。

Method: 提出Uni-LAP框架，通过紧密协作整合SCM和LLM：SCM使用新颖的Top-K损失函数生成候选条文，LLM采用三段论启发式推理来优化最终预测。

Result: 在多法域数据集上的实证结果表明，Uni-LAP方法持续优于现有基线，证明了其有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Uni-LAP框架成功解决了法律条文预测中的关键挑战，展示了监督分类模型与大型语言模型协同工作的优势，具有跨法域的通用性。

Abstract: Legal Article Prediction (LAP) is a critical task in legal text
classification, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
automatically predict relevant legal articles based on the fact descriptions of
cases. As a foundational step in legal decision-making, LAP plays a pivotal
role in determining subsequent judgments, such as charges and penalties.
Despite its importance, existing methods face significant challenges in
addressing the complexities of LAP. Supervised classification models (SCMs),
such as CNN and BERT, struggle to fully capture intricate fact patterns due to
their inherent limitations. Conversely, large language models (LLMs), while
excelling in generative tasks, perform suboptimally in predictive scenarios due
to the abstract and ID-based nature of legal articles. Furthermore, the
diversity of legal systems across jurisdictions exacerbates the issue, as most
approaches are tailored to specific countries and lack broader applicability.
To address these limitations, we propose Uni-LAP, a universal framework for
legal article prediction that integrates the strengths of SCMs and LLMs through
tight collaboration. Specifically, in Uni-LAP, the SCM is enhanced with a novel
Top-K loss function to generate accurate candidate articles, while the LLM
employs syllogism-inspired reasoning to refine the final predictions. We
evaluated Uni-LAP on datasets from multiple jurisdictions, and empirical
results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing
baselines, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability.

TL;DR: 该调查分析了31个多语言视觉语言模型和21个基准测试，揭示了语言中立性与文化意识之间的关键张力，发现当前训练方法偏向中立性，而评估基准主要使用翻译方法，存在跨语言能力差异和训练目标与评估目标之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多语言视觉语言模型在处理跨语言文本和图像时的表现，探索语言中立性（一致的跨语言表示）与文化意识（适应文化背景）之间的平衡问题。

Method: 综述了31个模型和21个基准测试，涵盖编码器架构和生成架构，分析训练方法和评估方法，特别关注对比学习对语言中立性的影响以及多样化数据对文化意识的作用。

Result: 发现当前训练方法通过对比学习倾向于语言中立性，而文化意识依赖于多样化数据；三分之二的评估基准使用基于翻译的方法优先考虑语义一致性，近期工作开始纳入文化相关内容；存在跨语言能力差异和训练目标与评估目标之间的差距。

Conclusion: 多语言视觉语言模型需要在语言中立性和文化意识之间取得更好的平衡，训练方法和评估基准需要更紧密地结合，以更好地反映真实世界的多语言和多文化需求。

Abstract: This survey examines multilingual vision-language models that process text
and images across languages. We review 31 models and 21 benchmarks, spanning
encoder-only and generative architectures, and identify a key tension between
language neutrality (consistent cross-lingual representations) and cultural
awareness (adaptation to cultural contexts). Current training methods favor
neutrality through contrastive learning, while cultural awareness depends on
diverse data. Two-thirds of evaluation benchmarks use translation-based
approaches prioritizing semantic consistency, though recent work incorporates
culturally grounded content. We find discrepancies in cross-lingual
capabilities and gaps between training objectives and evaluation goals.

Motivation: 现有的通用大语言模型和定制领域特定模型无法准确解决食品命名实体链接任务，需要专门针对食品领域进行优化。

Method: 通过指令-响应场景，将文本中提到的食品相关实体链接到FoodOn、SNOMED-CT和Hansard分类法等本体，并对模型进行微调。

Result: FoodSEM在相关模型/系统中实现了最先进的性能，与零样本、单样本和少样本LLM提示基线相比表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 本文的主要贡献包括发布适合LLM微调/评估的食品标注语料库、发布推进食品领域语义理解的鲁棒模型，以及为未来基准测试提供食品NEL的强基线。

Abstract: This paper introduces FoodSEM, a state-of-the-art fine-tuned open-source
large language model (LLM) for named-entity linking (NEL) to food-related
ontologies. To the best of our knowledge, food NEL is a task that cannot be
accurately solved by state-of-the-art general-purpose (large) language models
or custom domain-specific models/systems. Through an instruction-response (IR)
scenario, FoodSEM links food-related entities mentioned in a text to several
ontologies, including FoodOn, SNOMED-CT, and the Hansard taxonomy. The FoodSEM
model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to related models/systems,
with F1 scores even reaching 98% on some ontologies and datasets. The presented
comparative analyses against zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot LLM prompting
baselines further highlight FoodSEM's superior performance over its
non-fine-tuned version. By making FoodSEM and its related resources publicly
available, the main contributions of this article include (1) publishing a
food-annotated corpora into an IR format suitable for LLM
fine-tuning/evaluation, (2) publishing a robust model to advance the semantic
understanding of text in the food domain, and (3) providing a strong baseline
on food NEL for future benchmarking.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Reasoning Capsule框架，通过将推理计划压缩为少量潜在标记来平衡效率和透明度，减少CoT提示的延迟和内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought提示虽然能帮助大语言模型进行复杂推理，但其冗长性增加了延迟和内存使用，且可能在长链中传播早期错误。

Method: 基于信息瓶颈原则，将高层计划压缩为少量学习的潜在标记（推理胶囊），同时保持执行步骤轻量或显式，使用任务损失和计划重建损失的双重目标。

Result: 在复杂基准测试中保持或提高了准确性，同时显著减少了推理的可见标记占用。

Conclusion: 该框架在效率、准确性和可解释性之间取得了平衡，为复杂推理任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs) tackle
complex reasoning by eliciting explicit step-by-step rationales. However, CoT's
verbosity increases latency and memory usage and may propagate early errors
across long chains. We propose the Reasoning Capsule (R-Capsule), a framework
that aims to combine the efficiency of latent reasoning with the transparency
of explicit CoT. The core idea is to compress the high-level plan into a small
set of learned latent tokens (a Reasoning Capsule) while keeping execution
steps lightweight or explicit. This hybrid approach is inspired by the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, where we encourage the capsule to be
approximately minimal yet sufficient for the task. Minimality is encouraged via
a low-capacity bottleneck, which helps improve efficiency. Sufficiency is
encouraged via a dual objective: a primary task loss for answer accuracy and an
auxiliary plan-reconstruction loss that encourages the capsule to faithfully
represent the original textual plan. The reconstruction objective helps ground
the latent space, thereby improving interpretability and reducing the use of
uninformative shortcuts. Our framework strikes a balance between efficiency,
accuracy, and interpretability, thereby reducing the visible token footprint of
reasoning while maintaining or improving accuracy on complex benchmarks. Our
codes are available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GTO通过引入草稿树奖励和基于组的草稿策略训练，解决了推测解码中草稿策略与解码时树策略不对齐的问题，显著提高了接受长度和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的训练目标只优化单个贪婪草稿路径，而解码时采用树策略重新排序和验证多个分支，这种草稿策略不对齐限制了可实现的加速效果。

Method: GTO包含两个组件：(1)草稿树奖励：无采样目标，等于目标模型下草稿树的期望接受长度；(2)基于组的草稿策略训练：稳定优化方案，对比当前和冻结参考草稿模型的树，形成去偏的组标准化优势，并沿最长接受序列应用PPO风格的代理进行稳健更新。

Result: 在对话、代码和数学任务以及多个LLM上，GTO将接受长度提高了7.4%，相比之前最先进的EAGLE-3实现了额外的7.7%加速。

Conclusion: 通过弥合草稿策略不对齐，GTO为高效LLM推理提供了一个实用、通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by
letting a lightweight draft model propose multiple tokens that the target model
verifies in parallel. Yet existing training objectives optimize only a single
greedy draft path, while decoding follows a tree policy that re-ranks and
verifies multiple branches. This draft policy misalignment limits achievable
speedups. We introduce Group Tree Optimization (GTO), which aligns training
with the decoding-time tree policy through two components: (i) Draft Tree
Reward, a sampling-free objective equal to the expected acceptance length of
the draft tree under the target model, directly measuring decoding performance;
(ii) Group-based Draft Policy Training, a stable optimization scheme that
contrasts trees from the current and a frozen reference draft model, forming
debiased group-standardized advantages and applying a PPO-style surrogate along
the longest accepted sequence for robust updates. We further prove that
increasing our Draft Tree Reward provably improves acceptance length and
speedup. Across dialogue (MT-Bench), code (HumanEval), and math (GSM8K), and
multiple LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Vicuna-1.3-13B,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B), GTO increases acceptance length by 7.4% and
yields an additional 7.7% speedup over prior state-of-the-art EAGLE-3. By
bridging draft policy misalignment, GTO offers a practical, general solution
for efficient LLM inference.

Motivation: Chain-of-Thought推理虽然能提升复杂任务性能，但由于冗长性导致推理延迟显著增加，需要一种高效的压缩方法。

Method: 采用多轮自适应Chain-of-Thought压缩框架，利用token弹性现象进行渐进式压缩，为每个输入确定最优压缩深度。

Conclusion: CoT压缩既有效又可预测，支持高效模型选择和预测，无需重复微调。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves performance on complex tasks but
introduces significant inference latency due to verbosity. We propose
Multiround Adaptive Chain-of-Thought Compression (MACC), a framework that
leverages the token elasticity phenomenon--where overly small token budgets can
paradoxically increase output length--to progressively compress CoTs via
multiround refinement. This adaptive strategy allows MACC to determine the
optimal compression depth for each input. Our method achieves an average
accuracy improvement of 5.6 percent over state-of-the-art baselines, while also
reducing CoT length by an average of 47 tokens and significantly lowering
latency. Furthermore, we show that test-time performance--accuracy and token
length--can be reliably predicted using interpretable features like perplexity
and compression rate on the training set. Evaluated across different models,
our method enables efficient model selection and forecasting without repeated
fine-tuning, demonstrating that CoT compression is both effective and
predictable. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MACC.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gearing up to surpass human creativity. The
veracity of the statement needs careful consideration. In recent developments,
critical questions arise regarding the authenticity of human work and the
preservation of their creativity and innovative abilities. This paper
investigates such issues. This paper addresses machine-generated text detection
across several scenarios, including document-level binary and multiclass
classification or generator attribution, sentence-level segmentation to
differentiate between human-AI collaborative text, and adversarial attacks
aimed at reducing the detectability of machine-generated text. We introduce a
new work called BMAS English: an English language dataset for binary
classification of human and machine text, for multiclass classification, which
not only identifies machine-generated text but can also try to determine its
generator, and Adversarial attack addressing where it is a common act for the
mitigation of detection, and Sentence-level segmentation, for predicting the
boundaries between human and machine-generated text. We believe that this paper
will address previous work in Machine-Generated Text Detection (MGTD) in a more
meaningful way.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上下文学习在处理大量示例时效率低下，监督微调则有训练开销且缺乏灵活性。需要一种能够整合多个信息块的方法。

Method: 通过元学习框架将上下文映射到适配器参数，生成的适配器可以代数合并，无需重新处理长提示。

Result: 在多项选择和抽取式问答任务上，CompAs优于上下文学习和先前基于生成器的方法，特别是在扩展到更多输入时表现更好。

Conclusion: 可组合的适配器生成为扩展LLM部署提供了实用且高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often seamlessly adapt to new tasks through
in-context learning (ICL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, both of
these approaches face key limitations: ICL is inefficient when handling many
demonstrations, and SFT incurs training overhead while sacrificing flexibility.
Mapping instructions or demonstrations from context directly into adapter
parameters offers an appealing alternative. While prior work explored
generating adapters based on a single input context, it has overlooked the need
to integrate multiple chunks of information. To address this gap, we introduce
CompAs, a meta-learning framework that translates context into adapter
parameters with a compositional structure. Adapters generated this way can be
merged algebraically, enabling instructions, demonstrations, or retrieved
passages to be seamlessly combined without reprocessing long prompts.
Critically, this approach yields three benefits: lower inference cost,
robustness to long-context instability, and establishes a principled solution
when input exceeds the model's context window. Furthermore, CompAs encodes
information into adapter parameters in a reversible manner, enabling recovery
of input context through a decoder, facilitating safety and security. Empirical
results on diverse multiple-choice and extractive question answering tasks show
that CompAs outperforms ICL and prior generator-based methods, especially when
scaling to more inputs. Our work establishes composable adapter generation as a
practical and efficient alternative for scaling LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. Despite its empirical
success, the tasks and model scales at which reasoning becomes effective, as
well as its training and inference costs, remain underexplored. In this work,
we rely on a synthetic data distillation framework to conduct a large-scale
supervised study. We compare Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) and reasoning models
of varying sizes, on a wide range of math-centric and general-purpose tasks,
evaluating both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Our analysis reveals
that reasoning consistently improves model performance, often matching or
surpassing significantly larger IFT systems. Notably, while IFT remains
Pareto-optimal in training and inference costs, reasoning models become
increasingly valuable as model size scales, overcoming IFT performance limits
on reasoning-intensive and open-ended tasks.

### [71] [The Outputs of Large Language Models are Meaningless](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22206)
*Anandi Hattiangadi,Anders J. Schoubye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过论证大语言模型缺乏必要的意图，得出其输出无字面意义的结论，但承认这些输出在实践中有用且看似有意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型输出的语义地位，质疑其是否具有真正的字面意义。

Method: 基于两个关键前提进行论证：(a)某些意图是LLM输出具有字面意义的必要条件；(b)LLM不可能拥有这类意图。

Result: 论证表明LLM输出缺乏字面意义，但能够解释为何这些输出在实践中仍显得有意义且有用。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM输出无字面意义，但它们在传递真实信念和知识方面具有实用价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we offer a simple argument for the conclusion that the outputs
of large language models (LLMs) are meaningless. Our argument is based on two
key premises: (a) that certain kinds of intentions are needed in order for
LLMs' outputs to have literal meanings, and (b) that LLMs cannot plausibly have
the right kinds of intentions. We defend this argument from various types of
responses, for example, the semantic externalist argument that deference can be
assumed to take the place of intentions and the semantic internalist argument
that meanings can be defined purely in terms of intrinsic relations between
concepts, such as conceptual roles. We conclude the paper by discussing why,
even if our argument is sound, the outputs of LLMs nevertheless seem meaningful
and can be used to acquire true beliefs and even knowledge.

*Tiago Fernandes Tavares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RTP框架，利用LLM构建二进制树，通过自然语言问题对文本进行语义分割，创建可解释的文本分类法，比传统关键词主题模型更易解释且在下游任务中表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型在数据稀缺领域表现不佳，使用关键词描述聚类需要大量人工解释且缺乏语义连贯性，存在可解释性差距。

Method: 引入递归主题分割(RTP)框架，利用大语言模型交互式构建二进制树，每个节点都是自然语言问题，语义上分割数据，形成完全可解释的分类法。

Result: RTP的问题驱动层次结构比BERTopic等基线模型的关键词主题更易解释，在数据主题与任务标签相关的下游分类任务中，这些聚类作为强大特征表现优异。

Conclusion: RTP为数据探索引入新范式，从统计模式发现转向知识驱动的主题分析，其主题路径可作为结构化可控提示用于生成模型，实现源语料库特定特征的一致模仿。

Abstract: Unsupervised analysis of text corpora is challenging, especially in
data-scarce domains where traditional topic models struggle. While these models
offer a solution, they typically describe clusters with lists of keywords that
require significant manual effort to interpret and often lack semantic
coherence. To address this critical interpretability gap, we introduce
Recursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP), a novel framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to interactively build a binary tree. Each node in the
tree is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data,
resulting in a fully interpretable taxonomy where the logic of each cluster is
explicit. Our experiments demonstrate that RTP's question-driven hierarchy is
more interpretable than the keyword-based topics from a strong baseline like
BERTopic. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters
by showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks,
particularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels.
RTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from
statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve
as structured, controllable prompts for generative models. This transforms our
analytical framework into a powerful tool for synthesis, enabling the
consistent imitation of specific characteristics discovered in the source
corpus.

*Yuhan Song,Linhao Zhang,Chuhan Wu,Aiwei Liu,Wei Jia,Houfeng Wang,Xiao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有语义语音分词器对不相关的声学扰动非常脆弱，导致下游LLM学习负担加重。本文提出StableToken，通过多分支架构和位级投票机制实现稳定的分词序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义语音分词器在信噪比很高的情况下，即使语音完全可理解，其输出分词序列也会发生剧烈变化，增加了下游LLM的学习负担。

Method: 提出StableToken分词器，采用多分支架构并行处理音频，通过位级投票机制合并表示，形成单一稳定的分词序列。

Result: StableToken在分词稳定性方面达到新的最先进水平，显著降低了各种噪声条件下的单元编辑距离，直接提升了SpeechLLM在各种任务上的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: StableToken通过共识驱动机制解决了现有分词器的脆弱性问题，为下游语音语言模型提供了更稳定的基础。

Abstract: Prevalent semantic speech tokenizers, designed to capture linguistic content,
are surprisingly fragile. We find they are not robust to meaning-irrelevant
acoustic perturbations; even at high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) where speech
is perfectly intelligible, their output token sequences can change drastically,
increasing the learning burden for downstream LLMs. This instability stems from
two flaws: a brittle single-path quantization architecture and a distant
training signal indifferent to intermediate token stability. To address this,
we introduce StableToken, a tokenizer that achieves stability through a
consensus-driven mechanism. Its multi-branch architecture processes audio in
parallel, and these representations are merged via a powerful bit-wise voting
mechanism to form a single, stable token sequence. StableToken sets a new
state-of-the-art in token stability, drastically reducing Unit Edit Distance
(UED) under diverse noise conditions. This foundational stability translates
directly to downstream benefits, significantly improving the robustness of
SpeechLLMs on a variety of tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Composite Reasoning(CR)方法，让大语言模型动态组合多种推理风格（演绎、归纳、溯因等），在科学和医学问答任务上超越现有方法，展现更好的样本效率和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型依赖单一的推理范式，限制了其在需要多样化认知策略的复杂问题上的表现。

Method: 引入Composite Reasoning方法，使LLMs能够动态探索和组合多种推理风格，包括演绎、归纳、溯因推理等。

Result: 在科学和医学问答基准测试中，CR方法优于现有基线（如Chain-of-Thought），也超越了DeepSeek-R1风格的推理能力，同时展现出更好的样本效率和适当的token使用。

Conclusion: 通过培养内部推理风格的多样性，LLMs获得了更强大、自适应和高效的问题解决能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities, rely on
singular, pre-dominant reasoning paradigms, hindering their performance on
intricate problems that demand diverse cognitive strategies. To address this,
we introduce Composite Reasoning (CR), a novel reasoning approach empowering
LLMs to dynamically explore and combine multiple reasoning styles like
deductive, inductive, and abductive for more nuanced problem-solving. Evaluated
on scientific and medical question-answering benchmarks, our approach
outperforms existing baselines like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and also surpasses
the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1 style reasoning (SR) capabilities, while
demonstrating superior sample efficiency and adequate token usage. Notably, CR
adaptively emphasizes domain-appropriate reasoning styles. It prioritizes
abductive and deductive reasoning for medical question answering, but shifts to
causal, deductive, and inductive methods for scientific reasoning. Our findings
highlight that by cultivating internal reasoning style diversity, LLMs acquire
more robust, adaptive, and efficient problem-solving abilities.

TL;DR: 提出反向投机解码（RSD）方法，通过教师模型生成候选token但学生模型基于自身概率分布决定接受与否，解决大模型向小模型知识迁移中的分布对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调方法在将大语言模型的推理能力迁移到小模型时经常失败，性能反而下降，这源于分布不匹配问题。

Method: RSD方法让教师模型提议候选token，但由学生模型基于自身概率分布决定是否接受，过滤掉对学生模型概率低的token。

Result: 在Qwen3-0.6B模型上，直接蒸馏导致性能下降20.5%，而使用RSD生成的数据训练后性能提升4.9%。

Conclusion: 低概率token是推理能力迁移的关键瓶颈，RSD生成的推理轨迹是模型特定的，分布对齐需要针对每个学生架构的独特内部表示进行定制。

Abstract: Transferring reasoning capabilities from larger language models to smaller
ones through supervised fine-tuning often fails counterintuitively, with
performance degrading despite access to high-quality teacher demonstrations. We
identify that this failure stems from distributional misalignment: reasoning
traces from larger models contain tokens that are low probability under the
student's distribution, exceeding the internal representation capacity of
smaller architectures and creating learning barriers rather than helpful
guidance. We propose Reverse Speculative Decoding (RSD), a mechanism for
generating student-friendly reasoning traces in which the teacher model
proposes candidate tokens but the student model determines acceptance based on
its own probability distributions, filtering low probability tokens. When
applied to Qwen3-0.6B, direct distillation of s1K-1.1 reasoning trace data
degrades average performance across major reasoning benchmarks by 20.5\%, while
the same model trained on RSD-generated reasoning traces achieves meaningful
improvements of 4.9\%. Our analysis reveals that low probability tokens
constitute the critical bottleneck in reasoning ability transfer. However,
cross-model experiments demonstrate that RSD traces are model-specific rather
than universally applicable, indicating that distributional alignment must be
tailored for each student architecture's unique internal representation.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a
novel software development paradigm known as "vibe coding," where users
interact with coding agents through high-level natural language. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks for code generation inadequately assess an
agent's vibe coding capabilities. Existing benchmarks are misaligned, as they
either require code-level specifications or focus narrowly on issue-solving,
neglecting the critical scenario of feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradiam. To address this gap, we propose FeatBench, a novel benchmark
for vibe coding that focuses on feature implementation. Our benchmark is
distinguished by several key features: 1. Pure Natural Language Prompts. Task
inputs consist solely of abstract natural language descriptions, devoid of any
code or structural hints. 2. A Rigorous & Evolving Data Collection Process.
FeatBench is built on a multi-level filtering pipeline to ensure quality and a
fully automated pipeline to evolve the benchmark, mitigating data
contamination. 3. Comprehensive Test Cases. Each task includes Fail-to-Pass
(F2P) and Pass-to-Pass (P2P) tests to verify correctness and prevent
regressions. 4. Diverse Application Domains. The benchmark includes
repositories from diverse domains to ensure it reflects real-world scenarios.
We evaluate two state-of-the-art agent frameworks with four leading LLMs on
FeatBench. Our evaluation reveals that feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradigm is a significant challenge, with the highest success rate of
only 29.94%. Our analysis also reveals a tendency for "aggressive
implementation," a strategy that paradoxically leads to both critical failures
and superior software design. We release FeatBench, our automated collection
pipeline, and all experimental results to facilitate further community
research.

Motivation: 全双工语音到语音LLM是自然人机交互的基础，但目前缺乏有效的基准测试和建模方法，特别是在紧急中断场景下的评估。

Method: 开发FLEXI基准测试，包含6种不同的人-LLM交互场景，系统评估延迟、质量和对话效果，特别关注模型在紧急情况下的中断能力。

Result: 研究发现开源模型和商业模型在紧急意识、轮次终止和交互延迟方面存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 下一对令牌预测是实现真正无缝和类人全双工交互的有前途方向。

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech-to-Speech Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling real-time spoken dialogue systems.
However, benchmarking and modeling these models remains a fundamental
challenge. We introduce FLEXI, the first benchmark for full-duplex LLM-human
spoken interaction that explicitly incorporates model interruption in emergency
scenarios. FLEXI systematically evaluates the latency, quality, and
conversational effectiveness of real-time dialogue through six diverse
human-LLM interaction scenarios, revealing significant gaps between open source
and commercial models in emergency awareness, turn terminating, and interaction
latency. Finally, we suggest that next token-pair prediction offers a promising
path toward achieving truly seamless and human-like full-duplex interaction.

TL;DR: 本文从法律合规角度解决LLM安全问题，提出安全合规概念，基于欧盟AI法案和GDPR构建新基准，并通过GRPO对齐方法开发了Compliance Reasoner，在基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全方法依赖临时分类法，缺乏系统化保护，无法确保现代LLM系统复杂行为的安全性。

Method: 1) 基于法律框架构建安全合规基准；2) 使用GRPO方法对齐Qwen3-8B构建Compliance Reasoner安全推理器。

Result: Compliance Reasoner在新基准上表现优异，欧盟AI法案平均提升10.45%，GDPR平均提升11.85%。

Conclusion: 从法律合规角度解决LLM安全问题是有效方法，Compliance Reasoner能显著提升LLM的安全合规性。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable
capabilities, elevating the critical importance of LLM safety. However,
existing safety methods rely on ad-hoc taxonomy and lack a rigorous, systematic
protection, failing to ensure safety for the nuanced and complex behaviors of
modern LLM systems. To address this problem, we solve LLM safety from legal
compliance perspectives, named safety compliance. In this work, we posit
relevant established legal frameworks as safety standards for defining and
measuring safety compliance, including the EU AI Act and GDPR, which serve as
core legal frameworks for AI safety and data security in Europe. To bridge the
gap between LLM safety and legal compliance, we first develop a new benchmark
for safety compliance by generating realistic LLM safety scenarios seeded with
legal statutes. Subsequently, we align Qwen3-8B using Group Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to construct a safety reasoner, Compliance Reasoner, which effectively
aligns LLMs with legal standards to mitigate safety risks. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the Compliance Reasoner achieves superior
performance on the new benchmark, with average improvements of +10.45% for the
EU AI Act and +11.85% for GDPR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSKG-LLM是一个创新的大语言模型架构，旨在将知识图谱的结构和语义信息有效整合到LLM的推理过程中，解决现有方法将知识图谱视为纯文本而忽略结构信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM处理幻觉问题的主要方法是结合知识图谱，但通常只将知识图谱视为纯文本，仅提取语义信息而忽略了关键的结构方面。另一个挑战是知识图谱编码器和LLM文本嵌入空间之间的差距，阻碍了结构化知识的有效整合。

Method: SSKG-LLM包含知识图谱检索(KGR)模块和知识图谱编码(KGE)模块来在利用结构的同时保留语义，然后加入知识图谱适应(KGA)模块使LLM能够理解知识图谱嵌入。

Result: 通过广泛的实验和详细分析，探索了如何通过整合知识图谱的结构信息来增强LLM的事实推理能力。

Conclusion: SSKG-LLM能够有效整合知识图谱的结构和语义信息，显著提升大语言模型的事实推理能力，为解决幻觉问题提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Currently, the main approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle the
hallucination issue is incorporating Knowledge Graphs(KGs).However, LLMs
typically treat KGs as plain text, extracting only semantic information and
limiting their use of the crucial structural aspects of KGs. Another challenge
is the gap between the embedding spaces of KGs encoders and LLMs text
embeddings, which hinders the effective integration of structured knowledge. To
overcome these obstacles, we put forward the SSKG-LLM, an innovative model
architecture that is designed to efficiently integrate both the Structural and
Semantic information of KGs into the reasoning processes of LLMs. SSKG-LLM
incorporates the Knowledge Graph Retrieval (KGR) module and the Knowledge Graph
Encoding (KGE) module to preserve semantics while utilizing structure. Then,
the Knowledge Graph Adaptation (KGA) module is incorporated to enable LLMs to
understand KGs embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments and provide a
detailed analysis to explore how incorporating the structural information of
KGs can enhance the factual reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our code are available

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统性地探讨了可解释性与公平性在仇恨言论检测中的关系，发现基于输入的解释能有效识别偏见预测并作为训练中减少偏见的监督信号，但在选择公平模型方面不可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP模型经常复制或放大训练数据中的社会偏见，而其黑盒特性使得用户难以识别偏见预测，开发者难以有效缓解偏见。现有关于公平NLP中可解释性的研究主要是定性的，缺乏大规模定量分析。

Method: 在仇恨言论检测中，针对编码器和仅解码器模型，系统研究了三个关键维度：识别偏见预测、选择公平模型、在模型训练中缓解偏见。

Result: 基于输入的解释能有效检测偏见预测，并可作为减少训练中偏见的有用监督信号，但在选择公平模型候选者方面不可靠。

Conclusion: 可解释性工具在检测和缓解偏见方面具有实用价值，但不能单独用于模型选择决策，需要结合其他公平性评估方法。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) models often replicate or amplify social
bias from training data, raising concerns about fairness. At the same time,
their black-box nature makes it difficult for users to recognize biased
predictions and for developers to effectively mitigate them. While some studies
suggest that input-based explanations can help detect and mitigate bias, others
question their reliability in ensuring fairness. Existing research on
explainability in fair NLP has been predominantly qualitative, with limited
large-scale quantitative analysis. In this work, we conduct the first
systematic study of the relationship between explainability and fairness in
hate speech detection, focusing on both encoder- and decoder-only models. We
examine three key dimensions: (1) identifying biased predictions, (2) selecting
fair models, and (3) mitigating bias during model training. Our findings show
that input-based explanations can effectively detect biased predictions and
serve as useful supervision for reducing bias during training, but they are
unreliable for selecting fair models among candidates.

Method: 使用MALLS和Willow数据集，比较编码器-解码器与仅解码器架构，探索词汇扩展、谓词条件化和多语言训练等技术，引入精确匹配、逻辑等价和谓词对齐等指标。

Result: 微调后的Flan-T5-XXL在提供谓词列表时达到70%准确率，优于GPT-4o、DeepSeek-R1-0528模型以及ccg2lambda等符号系统。谓词可用性提升性能15-20%，T5模型优于更大的仅解码器LLMs，模型能泛化到FOLIO数据集中的未见逻辑论证。

Conclusion: 结构逻辑翻译证明是鲁棒的，但谓词提取成为主要瓶颈。

Abstract: Automating the translation of natural language to first-order logic (FOL) is
crucial for knowledge representation and formal methods, yet remains
challenging. We present a systematic evaluation of fine-tuned LLMs for this
task, comparing architectures (encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only) and training
strategies. Using the MALLS and Willow datasets, we explore techniques like
vocabulary extension, predicate conditioning, and multilingual training,
introducing metrics for exact match, logical equivalence, and predicate
alignment. Our fine-tuned Flan-T5-XXL achieves 70% accuracy with predicate
lists, outperforming GPT-4o and even the DeepSeek-R1-0528 model with CoT
reasoning ability as well as symbolic systems like ccg2lambda. Key findings
show: (1) predicate availability boosts performance by 15-20%, (2) T5 models
surpass larger decoder-only LLMs, and (3) models generalize to unseen logical
arguments (FOLIO dataset) without specific training. While structural logic
translation proves robust, predicate extraction emerges as the main bottleneck.

Method: 生成有向图训练不同规模的Transformer模型，评估它们在各种图大小下推断传递关系的能力。

Result: Transformer能够学习低维网格状图的连通性，高维网格图更具挑战性；模型规模增大能改善泛化能力；多组件图学习困难。

Conclusion: Transformer学习传递关系的能力受图结构和维度影响，模型规模对泛化有积极影响，但在复杂图结构上仍有局限。

Abstract: Reasoning capability is essential to ensure the factual correctness of the
responses of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), and robust
reasoning about transitive relations is instrumental in many settings, such as
causal inference. Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of
transformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A
causes B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive
relations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,
knowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then
there is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can
learn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input
prompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from
training examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this
study, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train
transformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer
transitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that
transformers are capable of learning connectivity on "grid-like'' directed
graphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and
connectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that
the dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of
transformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional
grid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In
addition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly
better generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs. However, if the
graph is not a grid graph and contains many disconnected components,
transformers struggle to learn the connectivity task, especially when the
number of components is large.

invective language throughout 16th-century England. Subsequently, we assess and
compare the performance of fine-tuned BERT-based models and zero-shot prompted

Abstract: Recent advances in Bayesian probability theory and its application to
cognitive science in combination with the development of a new generation of
computational tools and methods for probabilistic computation have led to a
'probabilistic turn' in pragmatics and semantics. In particular, the framework
of Rational Speech Act theory has been developed to model broadly Gricean
accounts of pragmatic phenomena in Bayesian terms, starting with fairly simple
reference games and covering ever more complex communicative exchanges such as
verbal syllogistic reasoning. This paper explores in which way a similar
Bayesian approach might be applied to relevance-theoretic pragmatics (Sperber &
Wilson, 1995) by study a paradigmatic pragmatic phenomenon: the communication
of implicit meaning by ways of (conversational) implicatures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语料库缺乏长期时间结构，限制了LLM理解语言语义和规范演变的能力，需要支持历时变化分析和训练的资源。

Method: 从Project Gutenberg整理英语书籍文本，添加时间注释，通过时间敏感的VAD分析量化词汇语义变化，构建历史校准的情感词典。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at operating at scale by leveraging social
media and various data crawled from the web. Whereas existing corpora are
diverse, their frequent lack of long-term temporal structure may however limit
an LLM's ability to contextualize semantic and normative evolution of language
and to capture diachronic variation. To support analysis and training for the
latter, we introduce CHRONOBERG, a temporally structured corpus of English book
texts spanning 250 years, curated from Project Gutenberg and enriched with a
variety of temporal annotations. First, the edited nature of books enables us
to quantify lexical semantic change through time-sensitive
Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) analysis and to construct historically
calibrated affective lexicons to support temporally grounded interpretation.
With the lexicons at hand, we demonstrate a need for modern LLM-based tools to
better situate their detection of discriminatory language and contextualization
of sentiment across various time-periods. In fact, we show how language models
trained sequentially on CHRONOBERG struggle to encode diachronic shifts in
meaning, emphasizing the need for temporally aware training and evaluation
pipelines, and positioning CHRONOBERG as a scalable resource for the study of
linguistic change and temporal generalization. Disclaimer: This paper includes

*Max Malyi,Jonathan Shek,Andre Biscaya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型对风力涡轮机维护日志进行深度语义分析，超越了传统文本分类，实现了故障模式识别、因果链推理等复杂推理任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风力涡轮机维护日志中的非结构化文本包含丰富的运维智能，但传统定量可靠性分析无法有效利用这些信息。现有机器学习方法通常只停留在文本分类层面，无法进行复杂推理。

Method: 提出了一个探索性框架，利用大型语言模型进行深度语义分析，包括四个分析工作流：故障模式识别、因果链推理、站点比较分析和数据质量审计。

Result: 结果表明大型语言模型可以作为强大的"可靠性协作者"，不仅能标记文本，还能综合文本信息并生成可操作的专业级假设。

Conclusion: 这项工作贡献了一种新颖且可复现的方法论，将大型语言模型用作推理工具，为风能行业提供了一条增强运维智能的新途径，解锁了非结构化数据中先前被掩盖的洞见。

Abstract: A wealth of operational intelligence is locked within the unstructured
free-text of wind turbine maintenance logs, a resource largely inaccessible to
traditional quantitative reliability analysis. While machine learning has been
applied to this data, existing approaches typically stop at classification,
categorising text into predefined labels. This paper addresses the gap in
leveraging modern large language models (LLMs) for more complex reasoning
tasks. We introduce an exploratory framework that uses LLMs to move beyond
classification and perform deep semantic analysis. We apply this framework to a
large industrial dataset to execute four analytical workflows: failure mode
identification, causal chain inference, comparative site analysis, and data
quality auditing. The results demonstrate that LLMs can function as powerful
"reliability co-pilots," moving beyond labelling to synthesise textual
information and generate actionable, expert-level hypotheses. This work
contributes a novel and reproducible methodology for using LLMs as a reasoning
tool, offering a new pathway to enhance operational intelligence in the wind
energy sector by unlocking insights previously obscured in unstructured data.

*Tanise Ceron,Dmitry Nikolaev,Dominik Stammbach,Debora Nozza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 分析OLMO2开源模型的训练数据发现，左倾政治内容在数据集中占主导地位，且预训练数据比后训练数据包含更多政治内容。训练数据中的主要政治立场与模型在政策问题上的政治偏见高度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型已知会产生政治偏见文本，但偏见如何产生尚不清楚。当前LLM研究中训练数据的政治内容分析不足，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 分析OLMO2开源模型的预训练和后训练语料库，随机抽取大样本，自动标注文档的政治倾向，分析来源领域和内容，评估训练数据政治内容与模型政策立场的关系。

Result: 左倾文档在所有数据集中占主导；预训练语料比后训练数据包含更多政治参与内容；左右倾向文档通过不同价值观和合法性来源来构建相似主题；训练数据中的主要立场与模型政治偏见高度相关。

Conclusion: 需要在未来数据管理流程中整合政治内容分析，并对过滤策略进行深入记录以确保透明度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to generate politically biased text,
yet how such biases arise remains unclear. A crucial step toward answering this
question is the analysis of training data, whose political content remains
largely underexplored in current LLM research. To address this gap, we present
in this paper an analysis of the pre- and post-training corpora of OLMO2, the
largest fully open-source model released together with its complete dataset.
From these corpora, we draw large random samples, automatically annotate
documents for political orientation, and analyze their source domains and
content. We then assess how political content in the training data correlates
with models' stance on specific policy issues. Our analysis shows that
left-leaning documents predominate across datasets, with pre-training corpora
containing significantly more politically engaged content than post-training
data. We also find that left- and right-leaning documents frame similar topics
through distinct values and sources of legitimacy. Finally, the predominant
stance in the training data strongly correlates with models' political biases
when evaluated on policy issues. These findings underscore the need to
integrate political content analysis into future data curation pipelines as
well as in-depth documentation of filtering strategies for transparency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chimera是一个包含7500个高质量维基百科图表的测试套件，用于评估视觉语言模型对图表的真实理解能力，发现当前模型主要依赖三种捷径而非真正理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前视觉语言模型在图表理解评估中可能依赖知识、推理或模态捷径的问题，而非真正理解和推理图表内容。

Method: 构建Chimera测试套件，包含7500个维基百科图表，每个图表标注语义三元组和多层次问题，评估实体识别、关系理解、知识基础和视觉推理四个维度。

Result: 评估15个开源视觉语言模型发现，其看似强大的性能主要源于捷径行为：视觉记忆捷径影响较小，知识回忆捷径作用中等，Clever-Hans捷径贡献显著。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在图表理解方面存在严重局限性，需要更稳健的评估协议来基准化对复杂视觉输入的真实理解能力。

Abstract: Diagrams convey symbolic information in a visual format rather than a linear
stream of words, making them especially challenging for AI models to process.
While recent evaluations suggest that vision-language models (VLMs) perform
well on diagram-related benchmarks, their reliance on knowledge, reasoning, or
modality shortcuts raises concerns about whether they genuinely understand and
reason over diagrams. To address this gap, we introduce Chimera, a
comprehensive test suite comprising 7,500 high-quality diagrams sourced from
Wikipedia; each diagram is annotated with its symbolic content represented by
semantic triples along with multi-level questions designed to assess four
fundamental aspects of diagram comprehension: entity recognition, relation
understanding, knowledge grounding, and visual reasoning. We use Chimera to
measure the presence of three types of shortcuts in visual question answering:
(1) the visual-memorization shortcut, where VLMs rely on memorized visual
patterns; (2) the knowledge-recall shortcut, where models leverage memorized
factual knowledge instead of interpreting the diagram; and (3) the Clever-Hans
shortcut, where models exploit superficial language patterns or priors without
true comprehension. We evaluate 15 open-source VLMs from 7 model families on
Chimera and find that their seemingly strong performance largely stems from
shortcut behaviors: visual-memorization shortcuts have slight impact,
knowledge-recall shortcuts play a moderate role, and Clever-Hans shortcuts
contribute significantly. These findings expose critical limitations in current
VLMs and underscore the need for more robust evaluation protocols that
benchmark genuine comprehension of complex visual inputs (e.g., diagrams)
rather than question-answering shortcuts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个检测大语言模型中不可回答问题的简单方法，通过识别模型激活空间中的特定方向来分类可回答性，在抽取式问答任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常在缺乏足够信息时仍自信地回答，导致幻觉答案。需要解决抽取式问答中判断段落是否包含足够信息来回答问题的问题。

Method: 通过应用激活加法在推理过程中识别模型激活空间中捕捉不可回答性的方向，并将隐藏激活投影到该方向获得分类分数。

Result: 在两个开源LLM和四个抽取式QA基准上的实验表明，该方法能有效检测不可回答问题，并且在跨数据集泛化方面优于现有的基于提示和分类器的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能用于抽取式QA，还能扩展到其他不可回答性场景，如缺乏科学共识和主观性问题，因果干预表明该方法能有效控制模型的弃权行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often respond confidently to questions even when
they lack the necessary information, leading to hallucinated answers. In this
work, we study the problem of (un)answerability detection, focusing on
extractive question answering (QA) where the model should determine if a
passage contains sufficient information to answer a given question. We propose
a simple approach for identifying a direction in the model's activation space
that captures unanswerability and uses it for classification. This direction is
selected by applying activation additions during inference and measuring their
impact on the model's abstention behavior. We show that projecting hidden
activations onto this direction yields a reliable score for (un)answerability
classification. Experiments on two open-weight LLMs and four extractive QA
benchmarks show that our method effectively detects unanswerable questions and
generalizes better across datasets than existing prompt-based and
classifier-based approaches. Moreover, the obtained directions extend beyond
extractive QA to unanswerability that stems from factors, such as lack of
scientific consensus and subjectivity. Last, causal interventions show that
adding or ablating the directions effectively controls the abstention behavior
of the model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估LLaMA和Gemini在多语言法律任务中的表现，发现法律任务对LLM构成显著挑战，准确率常低于50%，且存在提示敏感性和对抗脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM主导时代，理解其在法律等高风险领域的表现至关重要，特别是在多语言、跨司法管辖区和对抗性环境中的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用LLM-as-a-Judge方法评估LLaMA和Gemini在多语言法律和非法律基准上的表现，通过字符和词级扰动测试对抗鲁棒性，并开发开源模块化评估管道。

Result: 法律任务准确率显著低于通用任务（LEXam低于50% vs XNLI超过70%），LLaMA弱于Gemini（平均差24个百分点），英语表现更稳定但不总是更准确，性能与语言和英语的句法相似性相关。

Conclusion: 尽管新LLM有所改进，但在关键多语言法律应用中可靠部署仍面临挑战，需要进一步研究提升法律任务性能。

Abstract: In an era dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), understanding their
capabilities and limitations, especially in high-stakes fields like law, is
crucial. While LLMs such as Meta's LLaMA, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini,
DeepSeek, and other emerging models are increasingly integrated into legal
workflows, their performance in multilingual, jurisdictionally diverse, and
adversarial contexts remains insufficiently explored. This work evaluates LLaMA
and Gemini on multilingual legal and non-legal benchmarks, and assesses their
adversarial robustness in legal tasks through character and word-level
perturbations. We use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for human-aligned evaluation.
We moreover present an open-source, modular evaluation pipeline designed to
support multilingual, task-diverse benchmarking of any combination of LLMs and
datasets, with a particular focus on legal tasks, including classification,
summarization, open questions, and general reasoning. Our findings confirm that
legal tasks pose significant challenges for LLMs with accuracies often below
50% on legal reasoning benchmarks such as LEXam, compared to over 70% on
general-purpose tasks like XNLI. In addition, while English generally yields
more stable results, it does not always lead to higher accuracy. Prompt
sensitivity and adversarial vulnerability is also shown to persist across
languages. Finally, a correlation is found between the performance of a
language and its syntactic similarity to English. We also observe that LLaMA is
weaker than Gemini, with the latter showing an average advantage of about 24
percentage points across the same task. Despite improvements in newer LLMs,
challenges remain in deploying them reliably for critical, multilingual legal
applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NeLLCom-Lex是一个神经代理框架，通过将代理置于真实词汇系统中并系统操纵其交际需求来模拟语义变化，特别在颜色命名任务中展示了神经代理能够重现人类类似模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有观察方法无法探究语义变化的因果机制，而人类实验方法难以应用于历时语义变化过程，因此需要新的模拟框架来研究语义变化机制。

Method: 使用神经代理框架NeLLCom-Lex，首先将代理置于真实词汇系统（如英语）中，然后系统操纵其交际需求，通过监督学习和强化学习管道训练代理。

Result: 实验表明，训练用于'说'现有语言的神经代理能够在颜色命名任务中显著重现人类类似模式，支持进一步使用NeLLCom-Lex来阐明语义变化机制。

Conclusion: NeLLCom-Lex框架能够有效模拟语义变化过程，为研究语义变化的因果机制提供了新的实验途径。

Abstract: Lexical semantic change has primarily been investigated with observational
and experimental methods; however, observational methods (corpus analysis,
distributional semantic modeling) cannot get at causal mechanisms, and
experimental paradigms with humans are hard to apply to semantic change due to
the extended diachronic processes involved. This work introduces NeLLCom-Lex, a
neural-agent framework designed to simulate semantic change by first grounding
agents in a real lexical system (e.g. English) and then systematically
manipulating their communicative needs. Using a well-established color naming
task, we simulate the evolution of a lexical system within a single generation,
and study which factors lead agents to: (i) develop human-like naming behavior
and lexicons, and (ii) change their behavior and lexicons according to their
communicative needs. Our experiments with different supervised and
reinforcement learning pipelines show that neural agents trained to 'speak' an
existing language can reproduce human-like patterns in color naming to a
remarkable extent, supporting the further use of NeLLCom-Lex to elucidate the
mechanisms of semantic change.

Method: 提出解决方案分歧作为新指标，在三个代表性问题领域测试该指标对监督微调和强化学习策略的支持效果。

Result: 实验表明使用解决方案分歧能持续提高成功率，验证了该指标的有效性。

Conclusion: 解决方案分歧是一个简单但有效的工具，可用于推进LLM的训练和评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for problem-solving tasks.
Most recent work improves their performance through supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with labeled data or reinforcement learning (RL) from task feedback. In
this paper, we study a new perspective: the divergence in solutions generated
by LLMs for a single problem. We show that higher solution divergence is
positively related to better problem-solving abilities across various models.
Based on this finding, we propose solution divergence as a novel metric that
can support both SFT and RL strategies. We test this idea on three
representative problem domains and find that using solution divergence
consistently improves success rates. These results suggest that solution
divergence is a simple but effective tool for advancing LLM training and
evaluation.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了高效、可扩展且可解释的LLM表示方案，能够实时适应动态扩展的模型库。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results over various tasks,
and ever-expanding public repositories contain an abundance of pre-trained
models. Therefore, identifying the best-performing LLM for a given task is a
significant challenge. Previous works have suggested learning LLM
representations to address this. However, these approaches present limited
scalability and require costly retraining to encompass additional models and
datasets. Moreover, the produced representation utilizes distinct spaces that
cannot be easily interpreted. This work presents an efficient, training-free
approach to representing LLMs as linear operators within the prompts' semantic
task space, thus providing a highly interpretable representation of the models'
application. Our method utilizes closed-form computation of geometrical
properties and ensures exceptional scalability and real-time adaptability to
dynamically expanding repositories. We demonstrate our approach on success
prediction and model selection tasks, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art
results with notable performance in out-of-sample scenarios.

TL;DR: AMBS是一个两阶段1对N框架，通过共享表示和并行分支策略实现多目标对齐，解决传统方法中的灾难性遗忘和推理碎片化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对齐方法存在灾难性遗忘（优化一个目标会覆盖其他目标）和推理碎片化（不同目标输出不一致）的问题，需要统一高效的多目标对齐方案。

Method: 两阶段框架：阶段I计算共享的Transformer层后注意力隐藏状态；阶段II克隆表示到并行分支，通过策略参考机制进行目标特定控制。

Result: 在Alpaca、BeaverTails和TruthfulQA上的实验表明，AMBS显著提升HHH对齐，在DeepSeek-7B上平均对齐分数提升32.4%，不安全输出减少11.0%。

Conclusion: AMBS能够有效实现多目标对齐，在保持跨目标一致性的同时提升性能，与最先进方法竞争力相当。

Abstract: Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) along multiple
objectives-helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (HHH)-is critical for safe
and reliable deployment. Prior work has used steering vector-small control
signals injected into hidden states-to guide LLM outputs, typically via
one-to-one (1-to-1) Transformer decoders. In this setting, optimizing a single
alignment objective can inadvertently overwrite representations learned for
other objectives, leading to catastrophic forgetting. More recent approaches
extend steering vectors via one-to-many (1-to-N) Transformer decoders. While
this alleviates catastrophic forgetting, naive multi-branch designs optimize
each objective independently, which can cause inference fragmentation-outputs
across HHH objectives may become inconsistent. We propose Adaptive Multi-Branch
Steering (AMBS), a two-stage 1-to-N framework for unified and efficient
multi-objective alignment. In Stage I, post-attention hidden states of the
Transformer layer are computed once to form a shared representation. In Stage
II, this representation is cloned into parallel branches and steered via a
policy-reference mechanism, enabling objective-specific control while
maintaining cross-objective consistency. Empirical evaluations on Alpaca,
BeaverTails, and TruthfulQA show that AMBS consistently improves HHH alignment
across multiple 7B LLM backbones. For example, on DeepSeek-7B, AMBS improves
average alignment scores by +32.4% and reduces unsafe outputs by 11.0% compared
to a naive 1-to-N baseline, while remaining competitive with state-of-the-art
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型训练的巨大计算成本阻碍了创新，虽然FP8训练理论上能带来显著效率提升，但缺乏全面开源训练方案限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 采用端到端FP8训练方案，结合持续预训练和监督微调，使用细粒度混合粒度量化策略来平衡数值保真度和计算效率。

Result: 在160B token语料上的持续预训练实验表明，该方法不仅稳定性好，而且性能基本无损，在推理基准测试中与BF16基线相当，同时训练时间减少22%，峰值内存使用降低14%，吞吐量提升19%。

Conclusion: FP8是BF16的实用且鲁棒的替代方案，将发布相关代码以进一步促进大规模模型训练的民主化。

Abstract: The immense computational cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents a major barrier to innovation. While FP8 training offers a promising
solution with significant theoretical efficiency gains, its widespread adoption
has been hindered by the lack of a comprehensive, open-source training recipe.
To bridge this gap, we introduce an end-to-end FP8 training recipe that
seamlessly integrates continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. Our
methodology employs a fine-grained, hybrid-granularity quantization strategy to
maintain numerical fidelity while maximizing computational efficiency. Through
extensive experiments, including the continue pre-training of models on a
160B-token corpus, we demonstrate that our recipe is not only remarkably stable
but also essentially lossless, achieving performance on par with the BF16
baseline across a suite of reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, this is achieved
with substantial efficiency improvements, including up to a 22% reduction in
training time, a 14% decrease in peak memory usage, and a 19% increase in
throughput. Our results establish FP8 as a practical and robust alternative to
BF16, and we will release the accompanying code to further democratize
large-scale model training.

Motivation: 传统逻辑推理范式不适合处理社交情境中的模糊线索和解释性过程，需要一种更接近人类社交认知的方法。

Method: 首先通过树状规划模拟人类思维的关联性和渐进性，构建认知流数据集；然后通过监督微调注入基本认知推理能力；最后采用强化学习优化认知流和响应质量。

Result: CogFlow有效提升了LLM和人类的社交认知能力，带来更有效的社交决策。

Conclusion: 认知推理范式成功弥补了传统逻辑推理在社交情境中的不足，为LLM的社会认知能力提供了系统化解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs trained for logical reasoning excel at step-by-step deduction to reach
verifiable answers. However, this paradigm is ill-suited for navigating social
situations, which induce an interpretive process of analyzing ambiguous cues
that rarely yield a definitive outcome. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Cognitive Reasoning, a paradigm modeled on human social cognition. It
formulates the interpretive process into a structured cognitive flow of
interconnected cognitive units (e.g., observation or attribution), which
combine adaptively to enable effective social thinking and responses. We then
propose CogFlow, a complete framework that instills this capability in LLMs.
CogFlow first curates a dataset of cognitive flows by simulating the
associative and progressive nature of human thought via tree-structured
planning. After instilling the basic cognitive reasoning capability via
supervised fine-tuning, CogFlow adopts reinforcement learning to enable the
model to improve itself via trial and error, guided by a multi-objective reward
that optimizes both cognitive flow and response quality. Extensive experiments
show that CogFlow effectively enhances the social cognitive capabilities of
LLMs, and even humans, leading to more effective social decision-making.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于检索增强的评估管道(RAEC)，用于评估LLM生成的医患消息回复草稿质量，通过引入临床错误本体论和两阶段DSPy提示架构，显著提高了错误检测的准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电子健康记录门户中异步医患消息的增加，临床医生工作量激增，需要LLM协助生成回复草稿。但LLM输出可能存在临床不准确、遗漏或语气不匹配等问题，因此需要稳健的评估方法。

Method: 开发了包含5个领域59个错误代码的临床错误本体论；构建了检索增强评估管道(RAEC)，利用语义相似的历史消息-回复对提高判断质量；采用两阶段DSPy提示架构实现可扩展、可解释的分层错误检测。

Result: 在1,500多条患者消息上的测试显示，检索上下文改善了临床完整性和工作流程适当性等领域的错误识别。人工验证100条消息表明，上下文增强标签相比基线在一致性(50% vs 33%)和性能(F1=0.500 vs 0.256)方面表现更优。

Conclusion: RAEC管道可作为患者消息的AI护栏，通过检索上下文显著提升LLM生成回复的质量评估效果，支持在临床环境中安全部署AI助手。

Abstract: Asynchronous patient-clinician messaging via EHR portals is a growing source
of clinician workload, prompting interest in large language models (LLMs) to
assist with draft responses. However, LLM outputs may contain clinical
inaccuracies, omissions, or tone mismatches, making robust evaluation
essential. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a clinically
grounded error ontology comprising 5 domains and 59 granular error codes,
developed through inductive coding and expert adjudication; (2) we develop a
retrieval-augmented evaluation pipeline (RAEC) that leverages semantically
similar historical message-response pairs to improve judgment quality; and (3)
we provide a two-stage prompting architecture using DSPy to enable scalable,
interpretable, and hierarchical error detection. Our approach assesses the
quality of drafts both in isolation and with reference to similar past
message-response pairs retrieved from institutional archives. Using a two-stage
DSPy pipeline, we compared baseline and reference-enhanced evaluations on over
1,500 patient messages. Retrieval context improved error identification in
domains such as clinical completeness and workflow appropriateness. Human
validation on 100 messages demonstrated superior agreement (concordance = 50%
vs. 33%) and performance (F1 = 0.500 vs. 0.256) of context-enhanced labels vs.
baseline, supporting the use of our RAEC pipeline as AI guardrails for patient
messaging.

Method: 构建了针对LLM的基准测试，包含1000多个经过人工标注的挑战性示例；提出了基于自由形式文本描述的新表示方法；评估了四个大规模LLM，分析最佳提示策略。

Result: 基准测试难度较高，最佳模型仅达到0.67的F1分数；发现模型倾向于错误标记缺失细节为不一致，且难以处理与模型参数知识一致但源文本中不存在的信息。

Conclusion: LLM在定位上下文幻觉任务上仍面临挑战，需要改进提示策略和解决模型对参数知识的过度依赖问题。

Abstract: Context-grounded hallucinations are cases where model outputs contain
information not verifiable against the source text. We study the applicability
of LLMs for localizing such hallucinations, as a more practical alternative to
existing complex evaluation pipelines. In the absence of established benchmarks
for meta-evaluation of hallucinations localization, we construct one tailored
to LLMs, involving a challenging human annotation of over 1,000 examples. We
complement the benchmark with an LLM-based evaluation protocol, verifying its
quality in a human evaluation. Since existing representations of hallucinations
limit the types of errors that can be expressed, we propose a new
representation based on free-form textual descriptions, capturing the full
range of possible errors. We conduct a comprehensive study, evaluating four
large-scale LLMs, which highlights the benchmark's difficulty, as the best
model achieves an F1 score of only 0.67. Through careful analysis, we offer
insights into optimal prompting strategies for the task and identify the main
factors that make it challenging for LLMs: (1) a tendency to incorrectly flag
missing details as inconsistent, despite being instructed to check only facts
in the output; and (2) difficulty with outputs containing factually correct
information absent from the source - and thus not verifiable - due to alignment
with the model's parametric knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为自然语言结构建模提供一个严格且可解释的基础，验证次正则层次结构在语言学习中的适用性。

Method: 使用判定谓词表示次正则语言类，通过线性模型进行学习，并在合成数据和英语形态学真实数据上进行实验。

Result: 合成实验在无噪声条件下实现了完美可分性，真实数据实验显示学习到的特征与已知语言约束一致。

Conclusion: 次正则层次结构为自然语言结构建模提供了严谨且可解释的基础，证明了其在语言学习中的有效性。

Abstract: We prove that all standard subregular language classes are linearly separable
when represented by their deciding predicates. This establishes finite
observability and guarantees learnability with simple linear models. Synthetic
experiments confirm perfect separability under noise-free conditions, while
real-data experiments on English morphology show that learned features align
with well-known linguistic constraints. These results demonstrate that the
subregular hierarchy provides a rigorous and interpretable foundation for
modeling natural language structure. Our code used in real-data experiments is

Abstract: Deliberation plays a crucial role in shaping outcomes by weighing diverse
perspectives before reaching decisions. With recent advancements in Natural
Language Processing, it has become possible to computationally model
deliberation by analyzing opinion shifts and predicting potential outcomes
under varying scenarios. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of
multiple NLP techniques to evaluate how effectively models interpret
deliberative discourse and produce meaningful insights. Opinions from
individuals of varied backgrounds were collected to construct a self-sourced
dataset that reflects diverse viewpoints. Deliberation was simulated using
product presentations enriched with striking facts, which often prompted
measurable shifts in audience opinions. We have given comparative analysis
between two models namely Frequency-Based Discourse Modulation and
Quantum-Deliberation Framework which outperform the existing state of art
models. The findings highlight practical applications in public policy-making,
debate evaluation, decision-support frameworks, and large-scale social media
opinion mining.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一套基于重采样的方法，用于量化多语言和/或多任务NLP基准测试中评估指标的不确定性和统计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验性能分数的变化既来自模型相关因素也来自数据相关因素，需要同时考虑这两者以避免显著低估假设重复实验的整体变异性。

Method: 使用重采样方法来量化评估指标的不确定性，考虑了模型和数据两个来源的变异性。

Result: 通过多语言问答、机器翻译和命名实体识别等示例任务，证明了重采样方法可用于计算排行榜中各种统计量的抽样分布。

Conclusion: 重采样方法是量化NLP基准测试中评估指标不确定性的有效工具，能够全面考虑模型和数据两个维度的变异性。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a set of resampling-based methods for quantifying
uncertainty and statistical precision of evaluation metrics in multilingual
and/or multitask NLP benchmarks. We show how experimental variation in
performance scores arises from both model- and data-related sources, and that
accounting for both of them is necessary to avoid substantially underestimating
the overall variability over hypothetical replications. Using multilingual
question answering, machine translation, and named entity recognition as
example tasks, we also demonstrate how resampling methods are useful for
computing sampling distributions for various quantities used in leaderboards
such as the average/median, pairwise differences between models, and rankings.

### [104] [StateX: Enhancing RNN Recall via Post-training State Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22630)
*Xingyu Shen,Yingfa Chen,Zhen Leng Thai,Xu Han,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StateX是一种训练流程，通过后训练高效扩展预训练循环神经网络的状态大小，提升长上下文信息回忆能力，而不显著增加参数或训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型处理长上下文时计算成本高，而RNN模型虽然复杂度恒定但状态大小有限，难以准确回忆长上下文信息。直接训练大状态RNN成本高昂。

Method: 针对线性注意力和状态空间模型两类RNN，设计后训练架构修改来扩展状态大小，参数增加很少或为零。

Result: 在1.3B参数模型上的实验表明，StateX能有效提升RNN的回忆能力和上下文学习能力，且后训练成本低，不影响其他能力。

Conclusion: StateX提供了一种高效扩展RNN状态大小的方法，解决了RNN在长上下文处理中的局限性，同时保持低训练成本。

Abstract: While Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable language modeling
performance, their high complexities result in high costs when processing long
contexts. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as linear
attention and state space models have gained popularity due to their constant
per-token complexities. However, these recurrent models struggle with tasks
that require accurate recall of contextual information from long contexts,
because all contextual information is compressed into a constant-size recurrent
state. Previous works have shown that recall ability is positively correlated
with the recurrent state size, yet directly training RNNs with larger recurrent
states results in high training costs. In this paper, we introduce StateX, a
training pipeline for efficiently expanding the states of pre-trained RNNs
through post-training. For two popular classes of RNNs, linear attention and
state space models, we design post-training architectural modifications to
scale up the state size with no or negligible increase in model parameters.
Experiments on models up to 1.3B parameters demonstrate that StateX efficiently
enhances the recall and in-context learning ability of RNNs without incurring
high post-training costs or compromising other capabilities.

Motivation: 为语言模型的推理过程提供原则性的概率视角，通过变分推理框架统一不同的训练方法，解决训练稳定性问题。

Method: 使用变分推理框架，将思维轨迹视为潜变量，提出多轨迹目标函数和正向KL公式来稳定训练，并证明拒绝采样微调和二元奖励RL可解释为局部正向KL目标。

Result: 在Qwen 2.5和Qwen 3模型系列上验证了方法的有效性，在广泛的推理任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个统一的概率框架，将变分推理与强化学习方法相结合，为提升语言模型推理能力提供了稳定的目标函数。

Abstract: We introduce a variational reasoning framework for language models that
treats thinking traces as latent variables and optimizes them through
variational inference. Starting from the evidence lower bound (ELBO), we extend
it to a multi-trace objective for tighter bounds and propose a forward-KL
formulation that stabilizes the training of the variational posterior. We
further show that rejection sampling finetuning and binary-reward RL, including
GRPO, can be interpreted as local forward-KL objectives, where an implicit
weighting by model accuracy naturally arises from the derivation and reveals a
previously unnoticed bias toward easier questions. We empirically validate our
method on the Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families across a wide range of
reasoning tasks. Overall, our work provides a principled probabilistic
perspective that unifies variational inference with RL-style methods and yields
stable objectives for improving the reasoning ability of language models. Our
code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/variational-reasoning.

### [106] [Language Models Can Learn from Verbal Feedback Without Scalar Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22638)
*Renjie Luo,Zichen Liu,Xiangyan Liu,Chao Du,Min Lin,Wenhu Chen,Wei Lu,Tianyu Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出反馈条件策略（FCP），将语言反馈作为条件信号而非标量奖励，通过最大似然训练和在线自举阶段，让LLM直接从语言反馈中学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法将丰富的语言反馈压缩为标量奖励，导致信息丢失和尺度不平衡问题，需要更丰富的方式让LLM直接从语言反馈中学习。

Method: FCP方法：1）离线阶段通过最大似然训练学习反馈条件后验；2）在线自举阶段在正面条件下生成并接收新反馈进行自我优化。

Result: 该方法将反馈驱动学习重新定义为条件生成而非奖励优化，为LLM提供了更丰富的从语言反馈中学习的方式。

Conclusion: FCP框架为LLM学习语言反馈提供了更富表现力的方法，将反馈驱动学习从奖励优化转向条件生成范式。

Abstract: LLMs are often trained with RL from human or AI feedback, yet such methods
typically compress nuanced feedback into scalar rewards, discarding much of
their richness and inducing scale imbalance. We propose treating verbal
feedback as a conditioning signal. Inspired by language priors in text-to-image
generation, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce the
feedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedback
pairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximum
likelihood training on offline data. We further develop an online bootstrapping
stage where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh
feedback to refine itself. This reframes feedback-driven learning as
conditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a more
expressive way for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback. Our code is
available at https://github.com/sail-sg/feedback-conditional-policy.

### [107] [Death of the Novel(ty): Beyond n-Gram Novelty as a Metric for Textual Creativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22641)
*Arkadiy Saakyan,Najoung Kim,Smaranda Muresan,Tuhin Chakrabarty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究发现n-gram新颖性虽然与专家判断的创造力正相关，但91%的高n-gram新颖性表达不被认为是创造性的，且开源LLM的高n-gram新颖性会降低实用性。前沿闭源模型产生创造性表达的可能性低于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨n-gram新颖性作为创造力衡量指标的局限性，因为创造力需要同时考虑新颖性和适当性（实用性和合理性）。

Method: 通过7542个专家作家标注（26名专家）对人类和AI生成文本进行细读评估，分析新颖性、实用性和合理性之间的关系，并测试不同LLM识别创造性表达的能力。

Result: n-gram新颖性与专家判断的创造力正相关，但91%的高n-gram新颖性表达不被认为是创造性的；开源LLM的高n-gram新颖性与较低实用性相关；前沿LLM识别创造性表达的能力高于随机但仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: 不应单独依赖n-gram新颖性来评估创造力，LLM在识别创造性表达方面表现良好但仍有提升空间，特别是在识别非实用性表达方面。

Abstract: N-gram novelty is widely used to evaluate language models' ability to
generate text outside of their training data. More recently, it has also been
adopted as a metric for measuring textual creativity. However, theoretical work
on creativity suggests that this approach may be inadequate, as it does not
account for creativity's dual nature: novelty (how original the text is) and
appropriateness (how sensical and pragmatic it is). We investigate the
relationship between this notion of creativity and n-gram novelty through 7542
expert writer annotations (n=26) of novelty, pragmaticality, and sensicality
via close reading of human and AI-generated text. We find that while n-gram
novelty is positively associated with expert writer-judged creativity, ~91% of
top-quartile expressions by n-gram novelty are not judged as creative,
cautioning against relying on n-gram novelty alone. Furthermore, unlike
human-written text, higher n-gram novelty in open-source LLMs correlates with
lower pragmaticality. In an exploratory study with frontier close-source
models, we additionally confirm that they are less likely to produce creative
expressions than humans. Using our dataset, we test whether zero-shot,
few-shot, and finetuned models are able to identify creative expressions (a
positive aspect of writing) and non-pragmatic ones (a negative aspect).
Overall, frontier LLMs exhibit performance much higher than random but leave
room for improvement, especially struggling to identify non-pragmatic
expressions. We further find that LLM-as-a-Judge novelty scores from the
best-performing model were predictive of expert writer preferences.

TL;DR: WebGen-Agent是一个利用多级视觉反馈迭代生成和优化网站代码库的智能体系统，通过视觉语言模型(VLM)分析网站截图和GUI测试结果，结合回溯和最优选择机制，显著提升了网站生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的代码生成智能体在网站代码库生成任务中，仅依赖简单的代码执行反馈，无法准确评估生成代码的实际视觉质量和用户体验。

Method: 提出WebGen-Agent系统，使用VLM生成详细的文本描述和建议来评估网站截图和GUI测试结果，并引入Step-GRPO训练方法，将视觉评分作为过程监督信号来优化LLM的网站生成能力。

Result: 在WebGen-Bench数据集上，WebGen-Agent将Claude-3.5-Sonnet的准确率从26.4%提升到51.9%，外观评分从3.0提升到3.9；Step-GRPO训练使Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct的准确率从38.9%提升到45.4%，外观评分从3.4提升到3.7。

Conclusion: 综合视觉反馈和过程监督训练能显著提升LLM智能体在网站代码生成任务中的性能，为依赖视觉效果的代码生成任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive performance on repository-level code-generation tasks. However, for
tasks such as website codebase generation, which depend heavily on visual
effects and user-interaction feedback, current code agents rely only on simple
code execution for feedback and verification. This approach fails to capture
the actual quality of the generated code. In this paper, we propose
WebGen-Agent, a novel website-generation agent that leverages comprehensive and
multi-level visual feedback to iteratively generate and refine the website
codebase. Detailed and expressive text descriptions and suggestions regarding
the screenshots and GUI-agent testing of the websites are generated by a visual
language model (VLM), together with scores that quantify their quality. The
screenshot and GUI-agent scores are further integrated with a backtracking and
select-best mechanism, enhancing the performance of the agent. Utilizing the
accurate visual scores inherent in the WebGen-Agent workflow, we further
introduce \textit{Step-GRPO with Screenshot and GUI-agent Feedback} to improve
the ability of LLMs to act as the reasoning engine of WebGen-Agent. By using
the screenshot and GUI-agent scores at each step as the reward in Step-GRPO, we
provide a dense and reliable process supervision signal, which effectively
improves the model's website-generation ability. On the WebGen-Bench dataset,
WebGen-Agent increases the accuracy of Claude-3.5-Sonnet from 26.4% to 51.9%
and its appearance score from 3.0 to 3.9, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art agent system. Additionally, our Step-GRPO training approach
increases the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct from 38.9% to 45.4% and
raises the appearance score from 3.4 to 3.7.

TL;DR: VoiceAssistant-Eval是一个全面的语音助手评估基准，包含10,497个示例，涵盖13个任务类别，用于评估AI助手在听、说、看三个维度的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准不足以评估大语言模型和多模态系统的完整能力范围，需要更全面的评估框架来指导下一代AI助手的发展。

Method: 构建包含10,497个示例的基准，涵盖自然声音、音乐、对话等听力任务，多轮对话、角色扮演等说话任务，以及异质图像观看任务。评估了21个开源模型和GPT-4o-Audio。

Result: 发现三个关键结果：专有模型并非普遍优于开源模型；大多数模型在说话任务上表现良好但在音频理解上滞后；设计良好的小型模型可以与大型模型竞争。Step-Audio-2-mini在听力准确率上超过了LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual两倍多。

Conclusion: VoiceAssistant-Eval识别了当前模型的差距，为评估和指导下一代AI助手发展建立了严格框架。多模态输入和角色扮演语音模仿任务仍是挑战，在鲁棒性和安全对齐方面仍存在显著差距。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models and multimodal systems have
spurred interest in voice-first AI assistants, yet existing benchmarks are
inadequate for evaluating the full range of these systems' capabilities. We
introduce VoiceAssistant-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess AI
assistants across listening, speaking, and viewing. VoiceAssistant-Eval
comprises 10,497 curated examples spanning 13 task categories. These tasks
include natural sounds, music, and spoken dialogue for listening; multi-turn
dialogue, role-play imitation, and various scenarios for speaking; and highly
heterogeneous images for viewing. To demonstrate its utility, we evaluate 21
open-source models and GPT-4o-Audio, measuring the quality of the response
content and speech, as well as their consistency. The results reveal three key
findings: (1) proprietary models do not universally outperform open-source
models; (2) most models excel at speaking tasks but lag in audio understanding;
and (3) well-designed smaller models can rival much larger ones. Notably, the
mid-sized Step-Audio-2-mini (7B) achieves more than double the listening
accuracy of LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual. However, challenges remain: multimodal
(audio plus visual) input and role-play voice imitation tasks are difficult for
current models, and significant gaps persist in robustness and safety
alignment. VoiceAssistant-Eval identifies these gaps and establishes a rigorous
framework for evaluating and guiding the development of next-generation AI
assistants. Code and data will be released at
https://mathllm.github.io/VoiceAssistantEval/ .
